        "reference": " Duval, Clay and Nassau counties, from 1991\u20132008. A member of the Democratic Party, he was appointed to the post in 1991 by Governor Lawton Chiles to fill the remaining term of Ed Austin, who resigned to successfully run for mayor of Jacksonville. He was elected to a full term in 1992, re-elected in 1996, and ran unopposed in 2000 and 2004. At a February 6, 2007 news conference, the 66-year-old lawyer announced that he would not run for re-election in 2008. He subsequently returned to private practice, and was succeeded as State Attorney by Angela Corey. Shorstein grew up in Jacksonville and attended the University of Florida in Gainesville, where he received his bachelor's and law degrees. He was admitted to the Florida Bar on October 25, 1965. He was multiply honored for service in Vietnam as a Captain in the United States Marine Corps with a Bronze Star Medal with Combat \"V\", a Combat Action Ribbon, the Vietnamese Cross of Gallantry, and a Presidential Unit Citation. After the war, he was hired by Public Defender Lou Frost and worked in that office before switching sides to the prosecution in 1970 as Division Head and Chief Assistant State Attorney. In 1974, Shorstein began two years as General Counsel for the City of Jacksonville, then switched to private practice for 15 years. In 1991 he was appointed State Attorney. Among the cases prosecuted during his term was the Brenton Butler case, in which the 15-year-old Butler was wrongfully accused of murder, and was later acquitted. Since leaving office he joined the firm Shorstein & Lasnetski, where he works with his youngest son, Paul. He had recently been considered for appointment as the United States Attorney for the Middle District of Florida. His successor, Angela Corey (who had been fired by Shorstein in 2007), \"sent a letter to Florida's senators demanding that they oppose Shorstein's pending nomination as a U.S. attorney,\" writing that \"he should not hold a position of authority in his community again, because of his penchant for using the grand jury for personal vendettas\". As of June 10, 2010, President Barack Obama had selected career federal prosecutor Bobby O'Neill, out of Tampa, for the position. Harry Shorstein launched a new juvenile justice program in Jacksonville that takes a three-pronged approach to juvenile crime. To reduce juvenile crime, it encourages both early intervention in high risk populations and rehabilitation among offenders. For violent and repeat offenders, it promotes incarceration. From 1993 to 1996, juvenile crime in Jacksonville decreased dramatically, which a Florida State University study attributed to the implementation of the plan. However, the same cannot be said for the adult offender program, especially the murder rate, which has given Jacksonville the distinction of being Florida's murder capital for fourteen of last nineteen years.\n",

        "prefix": "Joe Bowman, born Joseph Lee Bowman (April 12, 1925 \u2013 June 29, 2009), was a Houston bootmaker and marksman called \"The Straight Shooter\",",
        "reference": " considered to have been a guardian of Texas and western frontier culture. Shortly after his death, Bowman was inducted posthumously into the Texas Heroes Hall of Honor at the Frontier Times Museum in Bandera. Bowman was born to parents Mark McKinley Bowman, Sr. and Margaret Clark Bowman, in Johnson City in East Tennessee. He was reared in Asheville, in western North Carolina, where he and his brother, Mark, Jr., watched Tom Mix and Gene Autry films as boys. When he was twelve in 1937, Bowman moved with his parents to Houston, where his father procured work as an auto mechanic and as a place of potential relief for young Mark\u2019s asthma. Young Bowman learned to shoot flies off the garbage can with BB guns. At the age of fifteen, he began apprenticeships with Roy Smith Boots and Palace Boots in downtown Houston. He was an active member of the Boy Scouts of America during his formative years in Houston and attained their highest rank of Eagle Scout. In 1943, he graduated from Sam Houston High School in Houston and was drafted into service during World War II, during which he was severely injured by a land mine and blown against a tree while stringing telephone lines for the Allies down a steep hill during the German occupation of France. He received three Bronze stars and a Purple Heart for his service as a combat infantryman in a US Army communications squadron in France during World War II. After the war, Bowman returned to Houston, where he attended the University of Houston for two years before he opened Bowman and DeGeorge Boot Shop in Rice Village. He toured alone as \"The Straight Shooter\". \"The Straight Shooter\" performed with pistol and rifle at gun shows and rodeos throughout the United States. One celebrated act involved lighting two candles, one on each side of an ax blade, then firing a. 22 caliber rifle at the leading edge of the ax blade. This would split the bullet and the two pieces of the bullet would extinguished the candle flames. He also routinely split playing cards in half with the same technique and had the accuracy to blast tiny saccharine tablets into powder, which were actually smaller than the. 22 caliber bullet itself. He also performed for King Hussein in Jordan, the ruling family of Kuwait and Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands. Bowman was sought out by law enforcement agencies around the world to give specialized firearm instruction and taught police Special Weapons and Tactics (S.W.A.T. ) teams and Federal Bureau of Investigation (F.B.I.) teams the techniques of \"instinct shooting\". Based in Houston, site of the Johnson Space Center, Bowman entertained American astronauts and Russian cosmonauts and he performed in the world famous Houston Astrodome many times. He also gave sharpshooting exhibitions at such events as the  Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo. Bowman\u2019s marksmanship drew the attention of Roy Rogers, John Wayne, Jock Mahoney, James Garner, James Drury, Sammy Davis, Jr., and Dan Pastorini, former quarterback of the Houston Oilers. Drury, a Houston resident and co-star of NBC\u2019s The Virginian western television series from 1962\u20131971, told The New York Times, \"I\u2019ve seen fast, I\u2019ve seen faster, I\u2019ve seen fastest, and then I\u2019ve seen Joe Bowman\". Bowman\u2019s son, Mark Bowman, of Austin, Texas said in an interview with the Houston Chronicle that his father \"loved an era of bygone days and lived by that code. We lost a part of Houston\u2019s heritage and a great guardian of Texas culture and history\". Until the last days of his life, Bowman took part in shooting exhibitions. Pastorini called Bowman \"probably one of the most unselfish men I\u2019ve ever met. He had a heart of gold and whenever you needed him, he was always there. He always had time for kids and charities \u2026 to talk about his gunslinging and his adeptness at handling a weapon,\" Pastorini told The Chronicle. In 1989, on the occasion of the death of his close friend, actor/stuntman Jock Mahoney, Bowman issued a stirring tribute written by Mahoney entitled \"Coming Home\", preserved on Bowman's Internet site. Mahoney starred in the former CBS western Yancy Derringer. The poem was read in 1990 in Studio City, California, by Jock Mahoney's widow, Autumn, at a memorial tribute to Mahoney, who died at seventy of a stroke prompted by a road accident in Washington State. Bowman made two pairs of boots for Roy Rogers, which are displayed in the Roy Rogers-Dale Evans Museum in Branson, Missouri. In the early 1960s, Bowman ended his bootmaking business and concentrated on his western show in which he wore a ten-gallon hat, an embroidered shirt and leather boots. He was a consultant to actor Robert Duvall for his role as Augustus \"Gus\" McCrae, patterned on the legendary Texas cattleman Oliver Loving, in the screen adaptation of Larry McMurtry's classic Western Lonesome Dove. He taught Duvall how to use a Walker revolver, once a favorite of the Texas Rangers. He also took Duvall to Bowman's favorite boot shop (Wheeler Boot Company) in Houston and introduced him to bootmaker Dave Wheeler, where the iconic boots Duvall wore as Gus were crafted. Sammy Davis, Jr. purchased several of Bowman's custom fast draw holsters and two sets of Bowman's custom retooled Ruger Blackhawk single-action revolvers, with extremely intricate engraving and the legendary \"smooth\" action on the trigger hammer, early in the 1960s. There is film circulating of Bowman and Sammy Davis, Jr. practicing fast draw against each other on a film set in Nevada during the Rat Pack era of the late 1950s. Bowman also designed and created several pivoting, reinforced competition Western fast draw holsters that created a paradigm shift in competition fast draw, resulting in faster competitive draw times in the late 1950s and early 1960s competitions. Into his 80s, Bowman still designed boots, belts and holsters for his friends, leaving seven decades of artisan expertise and master craftsmanship as his legacy. Bowman died of a heart attack in his sleep at a hotel in Junction, the seat of Kimble County in central Texas, where he and his wife of seventeen years, Betty Reid-Bowman, had stopped for the evening while en route to their home in Houston following an exhibition trip to Albuquerque, New Mexico. Mrs. Bowman said that her husband had been in good health though he wore a pacemaker. He was \"soft-spoken and he was a man\u2019s man,\" his widow told The Chronicle. In addition to his wife and son, Bowman was survived by a daughter, Jan Bowman of Dallas, Texas; a daughter-in-law, Charlene  Bowman of Austin, Texas and his brother, Mark M. Bowman, Jr., of Denver, Colorado. Bowman's father, brother, and son have the same names. In 1954, Bowman married the former Betty Fruge', (a Houston model and local TV star of the 1950s Houston television show \"Fashions in Motion\"), who despite the lack of background with weaponry but with Bowman's tutelage, became the U.S. &  North American female fast-draw champion. She appeared as the episode subject in 1962 on CBS's former quiz show, To Tell the Truth. The marriage ended in 1968 in divorce. Bowman is interred at Forest Park Lawndale in Houston. In an interview in 1992 with the Houston Chronicle, Bowman lamented the passing of television westerns and culture: \"So much of what I do is for the adults, reminding them of their childhood. What I remember is the morality of the westerns and of the cowboys. That\u2019s all that westerns were: morality plays, where there was good and evil. Now look at the movies and on TV: good can be bad, there\u2019s no distinct line. I don\u2019t think kids learn from that\". In 2006, the official State of Texas sculptor, Edd Hayes, did an extremely lifelike bronze of \"Joe Bowman \u2013 The Straight Shooter\" to commemorate his lifetime of achievement. Bowman was appointed \"Texas Ambassador of Goodwill\" by 4 Texas governors. He was also named international spokesman for Sturm, Ruger, & Co., Inc. and was asked by Bill Ruger, Sr. to star in a nationally televised safety message campaign for \"old model\" single action revolvers. Sturm, Ruger & Company, Incorporated recently introduced a limited edition \"Joe Bowman \u2013 Straight Shooter\" New Vaquero. 45 Caliber revolver into their line of traditional single action revolvers. United States Senator John Cornyn (R-Texas) wrote a stirring tribute to Bowman's life and legacy that was published on Sen. Cornyn's website on July 20, 2009. Additionally, in July 2009, The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Boston Globe, The Los Angeles Times, and the Houston Chronicle, among other respected newspapers around the country all wrote feature tributes on the extraordinary life of this decorated war hero, patriot, historian, celebrated marksman and Western artisan.\n",

        "reference": " of a radiative transfer model lies the radiative transfer equation that is numerically solved using a solver such as a discrete ordinate method or a Monte Carlo method. The radiative transfer equation is a monochromatic equation to calculate radiance in a single layer of the Earth's atmosphere. To calculate the radiance for a spectral region with a finite width (e.g., to estimate the Earth's energy budget or simulate an instrument response), one has to integrate this over a band of frequencies (or wavelengths). The most exact way to do this is to loop through the frequencies of interest, and for each frequency, calculate the radiance at this frequency. For this, one needs to calculate the contribution of each spectral line for all molecules in the atmospheric layer; this is called a line-by-line calculation. For an instrument response, this is then convolved with the spectral response of the instrument. A faster but more approximate method is a band transmission. Here, the transmission in a region in a band is characterised by a set of pre-calculated coefficients (depending on temperature and other parameters). In addition, models may consider scattering from molecules or particles, as well as polarisation; however, not all models do so. Radiative transfer codes are used in broad range of applications. They are commonly used as forward models for the retrieval of geophysical parameters (such as temperature or humidity). Radiative transfer models are also used to optimize solar photovoltaic systems for renewable energy generation. Another common field of application is in a weather or climate model, where the radiative forcing is calculated for greenhouse gases, aerosols, or clouds. In such applications, radiative transfer codes are often called radiation parameterization. In these applications, the radiative transfer codes are used in forward sense, i.e. on the basis of known properties of the atmosphere, one calculates heating rates, radiative fluxes, and radiances. There are efforts for intercomparison of radiation codes. One such project was ICRCCM (Intercomparison of Radiation Codes in Climate Models) effort that spanned the late 1980s - early 2000s. The more current (2011) project, Continual Intercomparison of Radiation Codes, emphasises also using observations to define intercomparison cases. For a line-by-line calculation, one needs characteristics of the spectral lines, such as the line centre, the intensity, the lower-state energy, the line width and the shape.\n",
        "text": ", the solid energy is then measured on a scale ranging from \u2212 2 to \u2212 5. There are two forms of water transport. The first is the percolation of liquid water into the ocean via a water column, similar to that of drilling fluid.

        "prefix": "In motor vehicles, a power steering system helps drivers steer the vehicle by augmenting steering effort needed to turn the steering wheel, making it easier for the vehicle to",
        "reference": " turn or maneuver. Hydraulic or electric actuators add controlled energy to the steering mechanism, so the driver can provide less effort to turn the steered wheels when driving at typical speeds, and reduce considerably the physical effort necessary to turn the wheels when a vehicle is stopped or moving slowly. Power steering can also be engineered to provide some artificial feedback of forces acting on the steered wheels. Hydraulic power steering systems for cars augment steering effort via an actuator, a hydraulic cylinder that is part of a servo system. These systems have a direct mechanical connection between the steering wheel and the linkage that steers the wheels. This means that power-steering system failure (to augment effort) still permits the vehicle to be steered using manual effort alone. Electric power steering systems use electric motors to provide the assistance instead of hydraulic systems. As with hydraulic types, power to the actuator (motor, in this case) is controlled by the rest of the power steering system. Other power steering systems (such as those in the largest off-road construction vehicles) have no direct mechanical connection to the steering linkage; they require electrical power. Systems of this kind, with no mechanical connection, are sometimes called \"drive by wire\" or \"steer by wire\", by analogy with aviation's \"fly-by-wire\". In this context, \"wire\" refers to electrical cables that carry power and data, not thin wire rope mechanical control cables. Some construction vehicles have a two-part frame with a rugged hinge in the middle; this hinge allows the front and rear axles to become non-parallel to steer the vehicle. Opposing hydraulic cylinders move the halves of the frame relative to each other to steer. The first power steering system on an automobile was apparently installed in 1876 by a man with the surname of Fitts, but little else is known about him. The next power steering system was put on a Columbia 5-ton truck in 1903 where a separate electric motor was used to assist the driver in turning the front wheels. Robert E. Twyford, a resident of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, included a mechanical power steering mechanism as part of his patent (U.S. Patent 646,477) issued on April 3, 1900 for the first four-wheel drive system. Francis W. Davis, an engineer of the truck division of Pierce-Arrow, began exploring how steering could be made easier, and in 1926 invented and demonstrated the first practical power steering system. Davis moved to General Motors and refined the hydraulic-assisted power steering system, but the automaker calculated it would be too expensive to produce. Davis then signed up with Bendix, a parts manufacturer for automakers. Military needs during World War II for easier steering on heavy vehicles boosted the need for power assistance on armored cars and tank-recovery vehicles for the British and American armies. Chrysler Corporation introduced the first commercially available passenger car power steering system on the 1951 Chrysler Imperial under the name \"Hydraguide\". The Chrysler system was based on some of Davis' expired patents. General Motors introduced the 1952 Cadillac with a power steering system using the work Davis had done for the company almost twenty years earlier. Charles F. Hammond from Detroit filed several patents for improvements of power steering with the Canadian Intellectual Property Office in 1958. Most new vehicles now have power steering, owing to the trends toward front wheel drive, greater vehicle mass, and wider tires, which all increase the required steering effort. Heavier vehicles, as are common in some countries, would be extremely difficult to maneuver at low speeds, while vehicles of lighter weight may not need power assisted steering at all. Hydraulic power steering systems work by using a hydraulic system to multiply force applied to the steering wheel inputs to the vehicle's steered (usually front) road wheels. The hydraulic pressure typically comes from a gerotor or rotary vane pump driven by the vehicle's engine. A double-acting hydraulic cylinder applies a force to the steering gear, which in turn steers the roadwheels. The steering wheel operates valves to control flow to the cylinder. The more torque the driver applies to the steering wheel and column, the more fluid the valves allow through to the cylinder, and so the more force is applied to steer the wheels. One design for measuring the torque applied to the steering wheel has a torque sensor \u2013 a torsion bar at the lower end of the steering column. As the steering wheel rotates, so does the steering column, as well as the upper end of the torsion bar. Since the torsion bar is relatively thin and flexible, and the bottom end usually resists being rotated, the bar will twist by an amount proportional to the applied torque. The difference in position between the opposite ends of the torsion bar controls a valve. The valve allows fluid to flow to the cylinder which provides steering assistance; the greater the \"twist\" of the torsion bar, the greater the force. Since the hydraulic pumps are positive-displacement type, the flow rate they deliver is directly proportional to the speed of the engine. This means that at high engine speeds the steering would naturally operate faster than at low engine speeds. Because this would be undesirable, a restricting orifice and flow-control valve direct some of the pump's output back to the hydraulic reservoir at high engine speeds. A pressure relief valve prevents a dangerous build-up of pressure when the hydraulic cylinder's piston reaches the end of its stroke. The steering booster is arranged so that should the booster fail, the steering will continue to work (although the wheel will feel heavier). Loss of power steering can significantly affect the handling of a vehicle. Each vehicle owner's manual gives instructions for inspection of fluid levels and regular maintenance of the power steering system. The working liquid, also called \"hydraulic fluid\" or \"oil\", is the medium by which pressure is transmitted. Common working liquids are based on mineral oil. Some modern systems also include an electronic control valve to reduce the hydraulic supply pressure as the vehicle's speed increases; this is variable-assist power steering. DIRAVI innovated the now common benefit of speed sensitive steering. In this power steering system, the force steering the wheels comes from the car's high pressure hydraulic system and is always the same no matter what the road speed is. Turning the steering wheel moves the wheels simultaneously to a corresponding angle via a hydraulic cylinder. In order to give some artificial steering feel, there is a separate hydraulically operated system that tries to turn the steering wheel back to centre position. The amount of pressure applied is proportional to road speed, so that at low speeds the steering is very light, and at high speeds it is very difficult to move more than a small amount off centre. It was invented by Citro\u00ebn of France. As long as there is pressure in the car's hydraulic system, there is no mechanical connection between the steering wheel and the roadwheels. Electro-hydraulic power steering systems, sometimes abbreviated EHPS, and also sometimes called \"hybrid\" systems, use the same hydraulic assist technology as standard systems, but the hydraulic pressure comes from a pump driven by an electric motor instead of a drive belt at the engine. In 1965, Ford experimented with a fleet of \"wrist-twist instant steering\" equipped Mercury Park Lanes that replaced the conventional large steering wheel with two  rings, a fast 15:1 gear ratio, and an electric hydraulic pump in case the engine stalled. In 1988, the Subaru XT6 was fitted with a unique Cybrid adaptive electro-hydraulic steering system that changed the level of assistance based on the vehicle's speed. In 1990, Toyota introduced its second-generation MR2 with electro-hydraulic power steering. This avoided running hydraulic lines from the engine (which was behind the driver in the MR2) up to the steering rack. In 1994 Volkswagen produced the Mark 3 Golf Ecomatic, with an electric pump. This meant that the power steering would still operate while the engine was stopped by the computer to save fuel. Electro-hydraulic systems can be found in some cars by Ford, Volkswagen, Audi, Peugeot, Citroen, SEAT, \u0160koda, Suzuki, Opel, MINI, Toyota, Honda, and Mazda. Electric power steering (EPS) or motor-driven power steering (MDPS) uses an electric motor rather than hydraulic system to assist the driver of a vehicle. Sensors detect the position and torque of the steering column, and a computer module applies assistive torque via the motor, which connects to either the steering gear or steering column. This allows varying amounts of assistance to be applied depending on driving conditions. Engineers can therefore tailor steering-gear response to variable-rate and variable-damping suspension systems, optimizing ride, handling, and steering for each vehicle. On Fiat group cars the amount of assistance can be regulated using a button named \"CITY\" that switches between two different assist curves, while most other EPS systems have variable assist. These give more assistance as the vehicle slows down, and less at faster speeds. A mechanical linkage between the steering wheel and the steering gear is retained in EPS. In the event of component failure or power failure that causes a failure to provide assistance, the mechanical linkage serves as a back-up. If EPS fails, the driver encounters a situation where heavy effort is required to steer. This heavy effort is similar to that of an inoperative hydraulic steering assist system. Depending on the driving situation, driving skill and strength of the driver, steering assist loss may or may not lead to a crash. The difficulty of steering with inoperative power steering is compounded by the choice of steering ratios in assisted steering gears vs. fully manual. The NHTSA has assisted car manufacturers with recalling EPS systems prone to failure. Electric systems have an advantage in fuel efficiency because there is no belt-driven hydraulic pump constantly running, whether assistance is required or not, and this is a major reason for their introduction. Another major advantage is the elimination of a belt-driven engine accessory, and several high-pressure hydraulic hoses between the hydraulic pump, mounted on the engine, and the steering gear, mounted on the chassis. This greatly simplifies manufacturing and maintenance. By incorporating electronic stability control electric power steering systems can instantly vary torque assist levels to aid the driver in corrective maneuvers. In 1986 NSK put the EPS for battery fork into practical use. In the subsequent 8 years Koyo Seiko (current JTEKT), NSK developed a column system exclusively for minicars, sold only in Japan such as Suzuki and Mitsubishi Motors. However, this simple method was noticeable due to the inertia feeling of the motor at the time of rapid steering for danger avoidance in low speed running, at the time of high speed running at which the steering force became small, returning to the manual steering. As a result, that system was not adopted. In the late 1990s, a direct full control system of a rack assist without clutch to a regular car was put into practical use in the Honda NSX (initially, automatic only) Since then, there has been a transition from a brush-attached motor to a brushless motor in the rack type of ordinary vehicles and this method has become mainstream. Electric power steering systems appeared on the Honda NSX in 1990,The MG F, the FIAT Punto Mk2 in 1999, the Honda S2000 in 1999, Toyota Prius in 2000, the BMW Z4 in 2002, and the Mazda RX-8 in 2003. The first electric power steering system appeared on the Suzuki Cervo in 1988. The system has been used by various automobile manufacturers, and most commonly applied for smaller cars to reduce fuel consumption and manufacturing costs. In 2000, the Honda S2000 Type V featured the first electric power variable gear ratio steering (VGS) system. In 2002, Toyota introduced the \"Variable Gear Ratio Steering\" (VGRS) system on the Lexus LX 470 and Landcruiser Cygnus, and also incorporated the electronic stability control system to alter steering gear ratios and steering assist levels. In 2003, BMW introduced \"active steering\" system on the 5 Series. This system should not be confused with variable assist power steering, which varies steering assist torque, not steering ratios, nor with systems where the gear ratio is only varied as a function of steering angle. These last are more accurately called non-linear types (e.g. Direct-Steer offered by Mercedes); a plot of steering-wheel position versus axle steering angle is progressively curved (and symmetrical).\n",

The advent of the ten-metre defensive rule in 1994 seemed tailor-made to Soden's nippiness around the rucks and his great form kept former captain Tony Rea in reserve grade during the clubs run to the preliminary final that year. Over the next 5 seasons, Soden was a mainstay of the North Sydney team. In 1996 he played 24 times and was in the side which lost to St George Dragons in the preliminary final. The following year, Norths made the preliminary final again against Newcastle Knights but missed the game due to injury. On 19 April 1998, Soden scored a controversial try against the Auckland Warriors involving a ball boy. Instead of placing the ball on the line to resume play, the ball boy threw the ball to Wade Horder who passed it to Soden. The Auckland players were not aware of what was happening and Soden darted off to score the try. In round 7 of the 1998 NRL season, North Sydney suffered one of their worst ever losses when they were defeated 60-6 by the Brisbane Broncos. In the aftermath of the loss, it was revealed that Soden and fellow Norths player Ben Ikin had been at a nightclub into the early hours of the morning on the eve of the game.

He worked with several other bands and artists, including Chris Caffery and BLAZE. Nick was born in Camden, New Jersey, the son of a US Navy Father, and studied architecture before pursuing a career in music. He grew up listening to his Mother's collection of soul, Motown and 60s and 70s British rock records. He began playing bass at age 13 to differentiate from his brother and others in his neighborhood who had opted for the guitar. He took bass guitar lessons in his youth. At the age of 19, he became a member of the heavy metal band Deadly Blessing from Turnersville, New Jersey, with which he wrote and recorded songs for their first album, titled Ascend from the Cauldron, published by New Renaissance Records in 1988. Two years later, he decided to leave the band and moved to New York City, where he changed his stage name to Nick Douglas and had brief experiences with a few New York area bands. In the summer of 1990, Douglas auditioned for the German hard rock singer Doro Pesch and was chosen among many candidates. Doro is the former singer of the German heavy metal band Warlock, which dissolved in 1989, and went on to become a successful solo artist. Douglas is the bassist of Doro's band since then and recorded several albums with her,  and has toured Europe and all over the world. Nick Douglas has also worked with other bands and musicians. He was in the line-up of Blaze Bayley's band BLAZE for the tours of 2004 and 2005, along with other members of Doro's band Oliver Palotai and Luca Princiotta. In 2005, he was the bass player for Chris Caffery, on his Faces tour and at the end of 2005, he reunited his first band Deadly Blessing, which had been inactive for a long time, for some live performances and the release of an album containing rare and previously unreleased material. At the end of the 1990s, Douglas began writing and recording songs that eventually made the album, Through the Pane. The album was released independently in 2001 and released in Europe at the end of 2006 on Painkiller Records. Douglas played bass on a track on Chris Caffery third solo album Pins and Needles in 2007 and went on tour with both Caffery and Doro. He also started to record a new solo album, to which he devoted himself to during the short breaks between tours. He also played with New York and Pennsylvania based acts like Mike Rocket and the Stars, EBE and the cover band American Tabloid, featuring also the drummer of Doro's band Johnny Dee. He is also the bassist and lead singer of the Nick Douglas band, which features current and former members of Doro's touring band, and performs his own music. Douglas composes and records music in his home studio and licensed some of his compositions to movie and TV companies. Nick\u2019s second solo album, Regenerations, was released February and March 2017 in Europe and The US respectively on the German label, Metalville. It went to #4 on the Metal Contraband \u201cmost added to radio\u201d charts in North America.

Sponsored by Mrs. Victor Sundrik, she was reclassified again to CVE-75 on 15 July 1943, and was commissioned at Astoria, Oregon, on 11 January 1944, with Captain W. V. Saunders in command. After intensive training off the California coast, Hoggatt Bay transported aircraft and crews to Pearl Harbor from 10\u201325 March 1944. Upon her return and further training in antisubmarine work, she sailed on 1 May for Pearl Harbor and Majuro. The combination of escort carriers and destroyers had proven itself effective against submarines in the Battle of the Atlantic, and was now to be used in the Pacific against the Japanese. Hoggatt Bay and a group of destroyers and destroyer escorts patrolled in the southwest Pacific from 26 May-19 June with notable success. scored a kill on Ro-105 on 31 May and  sank Ro-111 with depth charges and gunfire 11 June. These operations and those of other groups did much to reduce Japanese submarine interference with the invasion of the Marianas. Returning to the patrol area after a brief stay at Eniwetok, Hoggatt Bay's group provided air support and cover for the Marianas operation from 5 July\u20139 August, after which the ships returned to Manus Island. Next on the timetable of Pacific conquest was Peleliu, a valuable air base for further advances, and Hoggatt Bay sortied 1 September to furnish antisubmarine protection and search planes for the invasion. For nearly two months the escort carrier cruised these seas south and west of the Marianas in support of American operations., a member of her group, sank  on 3 October, and later in the month planes from Hoggatt Bay helped provide air cover for  as she struggled toward Ulithi. The ship arrived at Ulithi on 28 October, and sailed on 10 November to provide air support for the developing campaign in the Philippines. This was followed by amphibious exercises in Huon Gulf, New Guinea, in preparation for the Lingayen unit operations. Arriving at Manus on 20 December 1944, Hoggatt Bay joined the great task force which departed from that and other staging bases in late December for Lingayen Gulf. The voyage through the Philippines was a perilous one, as the Japanese attacked with their last desperate weapon, the suicide plane. Crewmen on Hoggatt Bay and the other ships fought continuously after 3 January, downing many of the attackers, but  was lost and other ships damaged. Arriving Lingayen Gulf on 6 January, Hoggatt Bay sent her carrier planes in to support the landings and destroy strong points despite suicide attacks; this vital work continued until 17 January, when the ship set course for Ulithi, and then San Diego. Temporary repairs at Ulithi and more extensively at San Diego were necessitated by an accidental explosion of bombs as aircraft landed onboard on 15 January off Luzon, Philippine Islands. The veteran escort carrier returned to San Diego 15 February 1945, and after much-needed repairs sailed 6 April to join the vast fleet arrayed off Okinawa in support of the invasion. She arrived Okinawa 8 May via Pearl Harbor and Ulithi and immediately took station south of the island to lend her aircraft to the carrier air forces engaged in the operation. Her planes flew direct support missions, photographic flights, and supply drops during the period from 8 May-24 June. Hoggatt Bay arrived at Leyte Gulf on 27 June, and after a month of training sailed on 28 July for Adak, Alaska. The surrender came while the carrier was en route, however, and the planned operation was replaced by occupation plans. After her arrival on 18 August, Hoggatt Bay sailed for Ominato. She arrived September and supported the occupation of Hokkaid\u014d and northern Honsh\u016b. During this period aircraft from the ship discovered many Japanese prison camps, and the ship had the pleasure of evacuating Lieutenant Colonel James Devereux, Marine Commander at Wake Island when captured by the Japanese. Hoggatt Bay also participated in the occupation of Aomori before anchoring in Tokyo Bay on 27 September. The escort carrier departed Tokyo on 30 September and, after a brief service with the \"Magic Carpet\" fleet, returned to Boston and was decommissioned on 20 July 1946. Placed in the Atlantic Reserve Fleet, Boston, the ship was re-classified CVHE-75 on 12 June 1955, and AKV-25 on 7 May 1959. She was sold for scrap on 31 March 1960.

        "prefix": "The New Zealand DA class locomotive were a class of diesel-electric mainline locomotives operated on the New Zealand railway system between 1955 and 1989. Consisting",
        "reference": " of 146 locomotives, it was the most numerous class to ever operate in New Zealand, with five more than the AB class steam locomotive. The class were A1A-A1A versions of the Electro-Motive Diesel G12 model, with the design altered slightly to run on New Zealand's  rail system, and fit the small loading gauge. They were introduced between 1955 and 1967 in three phases and were the first class of diesel locomotives to seriously displace steam traction. Between 1978 and 1983, 85 locomotives were rebuilt as the DC class, of which some are still in use. All but one of the remainder were withdrawn by 1989, with six preserved. The last locomotive was refitted for shunting duties and was rebuilt as DAR 517. The DA class have their origins in the post World War II period. Like most nations New Zealand\u2019s dominant form of railway traction was steam, with electrification being used in Wellington, the Christchurch - Lyttleton Line and through the Otira Tunnel. The General Manager of the New Zealand Railways (NZR), Frank Aickin, was an advocate for electrifying the entire North Island Main Trunk (NIMT) to alleviate the shortage of coal and the cost of importing diesel fuel; though he also recognised that steam and diesel traction would be required on other lines. Aickin went as far as negotiating a supply contract in 1946, but fell out with the government in 1951 and retired. His successor, H.C. Lusty, terminated the contract. After a disappointing experience with the DF class locomotives and facing significant capacity issues on the NIMT, NZR entered into an agreement with General Motors for the supply of 30 G12 model locomotives following a tender process. Designated by NZR as the DA class one of the major appeals was the guarantee of delivery within five months. They were the first locomotives supplied from the United States of America since the NZR WD class of 1901. With two production lines at London, Ontario and La Grange, Illinois two locomotives were completed every three days. At the time, they were the highest and widest locomotives ever used in New Zealand. This first batch, known as Phase I, (DA 1400-1429) entered service between August 1955 and January 1956. A second batch (DA 1430-1439) were built by Clyde Engineering in Sydney and entered service during 1957. Three further batches were ordered, all supplied by General Motors Canada's Montreal plant. The first 12 units (DA 1440-1451) were dubbed as Phase II and entered service in 1961. The 94 Phase III units entering service from 1962-64 (40) and 1966-67 (54), taking the total number in the DA class to 146. This final order saw the final end of steam traction in the North Island. At the same time the final DA was made, an order for smaller and lighter DB class locomotives was also placed with EMD. The class operated in the North Island. To facilitate their fast delivery a greater loading gauge was accepted meaning that initially they could only operate on the NIMT from Auckland to Paekakariki, and the Rotorua, Kinleith and Tokoroa branches. They were excluded from operating on many branch lines on account of their weight, and were restricted in their operations on the East Coast Main Trunk (ECMT) beyond Paeroa due to the lightly-laid line through the Karangahake and Athenree gorges. Instead the lighter DF and DB class locomotives handled traffic on this line. These restrictions were reduced as bridges were progressively strengthened, and in the case of the ECMT with the opening of the Kaimai Tunnel in 1978. Their axle loading was. The first (1955) locomotives had fabricated bogies welded from steel pressings and because of the roll on curves were restricted to goods service. Later batches (from DA 1440) had Dofasco cast steel bogies with an improved spring layout and were suitable for express working. The class were also unable initially to reach Wellington via the NIMT, as the tunnels south of Paekakariki built in the 1880s by the Wellington and Manawatu Railway Company did not have enough clearance under the 1500V DC Wellington suburban electrification overhead wires. The operational practice remained the same as it had in the steam age, with an exchange with ED and EW class electric locomotives taking place at Paekakariki. The tunnel floors were lowered south of Paekakariki in 1967 and the DA class could then operate all the way through to Wellington. Access to Wellington before this time for the DA class could only be achieved via the Wairarapa line and the Rimutaka Tunnel. The DA class were employed on all the major lines in the North Island: the NIMT, Marton-New Plymouth, Palmerston North-Gisborne and North Auckland lines. The success of the DA class in its reliability and performance meant that it was the major factor allowing the withdrawal of North Island steam locomotives by 1967. The class were successful in raising the freight capacity of the NIMT. The main limitation was the Raurimu Spiral, where a pair of DA class locomotives could haul 650 tonnes up the grade compared to 595 tonnes for their KA class steam predecessors. The class hauled all manner of freight and passenger services, including the Scenic Daylight service on the NIMT. The prestigious Silver Star overnight sleeper train was initially hauled by a pair of DA class locomotives when it was introduced in 1971. A dedicated pool of locomotives - DAs 1520-1527 and later joined by 1528 - were used for this service. The need for a more powerful locomotive that could haul longer and heavier trains on the NIMT had been identified, and in 1972 the first 15 DX class locomotives were introduced. While a single DX produced 70\u00a0kW less than a pair of DA class locomotives, it weighed 97. 5 tonnes compared to the combined weight of two DA class at 162 tonnes, which combined with more powered axles gave better traction and higher power to weight ratio. The Silver Star service was later transferred to the DX class, while the Scenic Daylight service had earlier been replaced by the Blue Streak railcars. The introduction of further DX class locomotives in 1975-76 ended the dominance of the DA class on the NIMT. Units were also employed on the Auckland suburban network, hauling 56-foot carriages. The 40 locomotives that were not converted to the DC class continued in service throughout most of the 1980s. The combination of the deregulation of land transport and the decline in rail freight volumes, reduced inter-regional passenger numbers, and the electrification of the NIMT saw them become surplus to requirements. Due to tunnel clearance problems on North Auckland Line through the Makarau Tunnel which prevented DC locomotives working in Northland, twelve DA class locomotives were given an \"A grade\" overhaul in 1980 with some modifications to improve crew comfort. They were painted in International Orange colours at the same time. The DA class established the initial numbering practice for NZR diesel locomotives, numbering the units sequentially with the class leader numbered in reference to the locomotives horsepower. While the locomotives were actually rated at 1425 hp, numbering started at 1400 and continued up to 1545. In 1979 the computerised Traffic Monitoring System (TMS) was introduced, with the remaining members of the class renumbered in sequence and the classification capitalised. Because this took place during the DC rebuild programme some units received a new DA series number before being withdrawn for conversion, upon which they received a new DC class number. Under the numbering DA 1400 became DA11 and DA 1516 became DA996, prior to it being rebuilt into DC4830. From their introduction, the class were painted in an overall deep red colour described as New Zealand Government Railways red. White or silver stripes were added along much of the length of the body, culminating in wings on each end. The units redesignated as DAA received gold stripes to differentiate them from other DAs and the DB units. Following the introduction of TMS many had their new road numbers applied to the long hood. During the 1980s some units were repainted in the International Orange livery (red sides, grey upper and lower surfaces and yellow safety ends) then being applied to other NZR locomotives, with the road number applied in large white type on the long hood. Many units were retired still wearing the original NZR red. In 1970, locomotives DA 1400-04 and 1406 were withdrawn from mainline duties and reassigned as heavy shunters to work in the new Te Rapa hump yard. They received additional low speed controls to assist in these operations, special in-cab Signals to incidate \"faster\", \"slower\", \"maintain power\" and \"stop\" for drivers linked back to the grid control tower by VHF radio, and a separate VHF radio channel for voice communication to the control tower. The locomotives were reclassified as the DAA class. These locomotives were identifiable by their yellow hood stripes, which were treated so to denote them as being used in special service apart from the DA class. The locomotives were later superseded by the DSG and DSJ class shunting locomotives, which were purpose-built for shunting as opposed to the DAA class being converted for that purpose, and were withdrawn progressively in the 1980s. Two DAA class locomotives have been preserved. On its withdrawal in 1983, DAA 1400 (TMS DA11) was cosmetically restored as DA 1400 and donated to the Museum of Transport and Technology (MOTAT) in Auckland. Placed on static display at MOTAT's Great North Road site, it was moved in late 2014 to MOTAT's Meola Road site to make way for an upgraded pavilion surrounding steam locomotive K 900. It is significant as the first of the DA class to have been built. The other, DAA 1401 (TMS DA 28) was withdrawn in 1986 and forwarded to Sims-PMI scrapyard at Otahuhu. In 1988, the locomotive was purchased by enthusiast Tony Bachelor, who moved it around various homes in the Auckland area as part of his Pacific Rail Trust. In 1999 it was leased to Tranz Rail, but received little use and was stored at Hutt Workshops. In 2005, the locomotive was re-activated, and in 2007 was loaned to Feilding and District Steam Rail Society at the conclusion of the lease agreement with Tranz Rail and Toll Rail. DA 1401 was gifted to the Feilding and District Steam Rail Society in 2008, who are now planning for its eventual restoration. In 1977 NZR decided to rebuild 30 of the later Phase III GM Canada-built DA class locomotives into the EMD G22AR model to become the DC class. Over seven years, 80 were rebuilt by Clyde Engineering in Adelaide, while a further five were rebuilt at Hutt Workshops using a mixture of components built at Hutt and Clyde. The first few were shipped directly to Port Adelaide, but after the Union Company withdrew its roll-on/roll-off services, most were shipped to Melbourne's Appleton Dock and hauled to Adelaide via the  Victorian and South Australian lines. Only one of the final batch of 54 Phase III DA class locomotives was not rebuilt - DA 1517 had been scrapped in 1974 due to damage sustained when it ran into a landslip at the entrance to the Fordell tunnel in 1973. Two locomotives - DAs 1533 and 1470 were both rebuilt from heavily damaged conditions sustained in accidents running light engine. 1533 was damaged in an accident while returning from National Park on banking duty in 1975; due to a rivalry between locomotive drivers at Taumarunui depot, the locomotive entered a curve too fast and overturned, killing the locomotive engineer. 1470 derailed on the steep Pukerua Bay section in 1978 returning to Wellington due to speeding on a curve, and nearly ended up on State Highway 1 below the line; both of the crew were killed. Ten of the Phase III locomotives were not rebuilt. Two of the Phase II locomotives - DAs 1441 and 1446 - were amongst those rebuilt. Many of the DC class remain in service today with ownership held by KiwiRail. Several were leased to Auckland Transport. One, DC4588, was exported to Tasmania in 1999, but found to be unsuccessful and was withdrawn in October 2002 with serious motor problems. After a long period of inactivity, the locomotive, which had been partway through a rebuild to make it more suitable for Tasmanian conditions, was sold for scrap by TasRail in mid-2011. In 1989, Tasman Pulp & Paper was looking to replace their resident Kawerau shunting locomotive, Bagnall 0-6-0DM NO 3079. This locomotive had been rebuilt in the late 1970s with a new Caterpillar D343T diesel engine and torque converter to make it more effective as a heavy shunter, but due to increases in traffic, was no longer able to keep up. NZR initially offered a DH class locomotive as a replacement. Tasman did not feel the locomotive would be up to the task. At the time, NZR was withdrawing the last DA class locomotives, and the decision was made to offer DA512 as a new heavy shunter. The locomotive was altered by chopping the front hood containing the dynamic brake components and altering the cab for better forward visibility. It was then renumbered as DA822 and was painted in Tasman's orange-brown colours before it entered service at Kawerau. This allowed the Bagnall to be withdrawn, and later scrapped after being offered to the Bay of Islands Vintage Railway. In 1998, Tasman decided to sell its locomotive back to Tranz Rail, who would then take over the duties of shunting the Kawerau yard with more conventional shunting locomotives. DA512 was sold to Tranz Rail who immediately moved it to Hutt Workshops for further alterations to make it more suitable as a heavy shunting locomotive. This included fitting shunter's refuges at either end of the locomotive and extended drawgear to accommodate the extra length of the refuges, as well as a repaint in the then-current \"Cato Blue\" livery. Renumbered as DAR517, the locomotive was released from Hutt in 1999 and allocated to the Kiwi Dairies milk factory at Whareroa, near Hawera. Here, it replaced ex-NZR Bagnall DSA414 (DSA 240, the sub-class leader) as the resident shunting locomotive. It was repainted in the Toll Rail \"Corn Cob\" colours in 2005, but was withdrawn from service in September 2008 for an overhaul and was placed in storage at Hutt Workshops. The locomotive was scrapped in December 2017. With the lack of ongoing operational requirements and the age of the units that were not rebuilt themselves the number of units was reduced throughout the 1980s. Most of the first batch delivered were withdrawn by the end of 1986. By 19 December 1987 18 DA class locomotives were still in service, with the majority (12) being in service for use on the North Auckland Line. In March 1988 the Railways Corporation began progressively introducing single-manning of trains. The DA class, along with the DJ class, were deemed to be not suitable for single-manning due to their cab configuration. By April 1989 only one DA class locomotive, DA512, remained. Following their withdrawal, most units were taken to Hutt for scrapping during the early 1990s, though a few were scrapped elsewhere. DA 1400/DAA 1400 (TMS DA 11) was donated to the Museum of Transport and Technology in Auckland in 1983 as the class leader of the DA class. Statically restored for static display. It was moved from its display location at MOTAT 1 in Great North Road, to the museums Meola Road site and undercover for conservation on 26 September 2014. DA 1401/DAA 1401 (TMS DA 28) was sold to Sims-PMI for scrap in 1986 but remained intact until purchased by Tony Bachelor in 1988 for his Pacific Rail Trust. Moved around Auckland, it was leased by the now-inactive PRT to Tranz Rail in 1997 although it only saw limited service and was quickly stored at Hutt Workshops. It was reactivated for Feilding and District Steam Rail Society by Toll Rail in 2005 and went on lease to them in 2007 before being donated by Bachelor to F&DSR in 2008. DA 1410 (TMS DA 126) was purchased from NZ Rail in 1988 by Steam Incorporated. Initially only requiring a repaint, it was overhauled in 1999 shortly before being sent on loan to the Railway Enthusiasts Society, who based it at the Glenbrook Vintage Railway. 1410 was on loan to the Glenbrook Vintage Railway, 1998. Returned to Steam Incorporated over the weekend of 6\u20137 June 2015 along with J 1234. There are plans to restore both DA 1410 as well as J 1234 in the future. DA 1429 (TMS DA 322) was purchased in 1987 by Tony Bachelor direct from NZR service. It moved around Auckland until leased to Tranz Rail in 1997 and saw regular service until 2003 when it ended up in Otahuhu. In 2010, Bachelor sold the locomotive to Auckland enthusiast Dean McQuoid who had it moved to the Glenbrook Vintage Railway where it is now based and used occasionally. Mainline certified in early 2015. DA 1431 (TMS DA 345) was purchased from NZR in 1989 by Steam Incorporated. It was also placed on loan to the Railway Enthusiasts Society in 1998. Stored at the Glenbrook Vintage Railway until 2008, it returned to Paekakariki in 2008 for restoration with RES-owned guards' van F 345. The restored locomotive returned to service in 2009. DA 1471 (TMS DA 725) was retained by Palmerston North depot staff in 1988 as a heritage unit. In 2002 it was leased to Steam Incorporated but was called back from its restoration base at Masterton by Toll Rail in 2007. Stored at Hutt Workshops, the locomotive deteriorated until purchased by Steam Inc. for preservation in 2012. It is currently under restoration. Only two of the locomotives, DAs 1429 and 1431 are currently mainline certified although there are plans for DA 1401 to be so.

        "prefix": "WWE SmackDown, also known as Friday Night SmackDown or simply SmackDown, is a professional wrestling television program that debuted on April 29,",
        "reference": " 1999. The show's name also refers to the SmackDown brand, to which WWE employees are assigned to work and perform. SmackDown is considered to be one of WWE's two flagship shows, along with Monday Night Raw. SmackDown currently broadcasts live on Friday nights on the Fox network, beginning on October 4, 2019, filling the entirety of the network's Friday night schedule; Fox Deportes simulcasts the program with Spanish-language commentary. SmackDown! debuted in the United States on UPN on April 29, 1999 and was formerly broadcast on Thursday nights. The show would move to Friday nights on September 9, 2005, and, after the merger of UPN and the WB, would begin airing on The CW in September 2006. The show would later move to MyNetworkTV in October 2008. On October 1, 2010, Smackdown moved to cable network Syfy, and would eventually return to Thursdays on January 15, 2015. The show then moved to the sibling USA Network on January 7, 2016, and later that year, beginning on July 19, 2016, SmackDown began broadcasting live on Tuesday nights. SmackDowns move to Fox on October 4, 2019 marked the show's return to Friday nights and over-the-air broadcast television (as well as the second time SmackDown has aired on a Fox-owned network). SmackDown has been broadcast from 163 arenas, 148 cities and towns, seven countries: United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Iraq in 2003 and 2004 for Tribute to the Troops, Japan in 2005, Italy in 2007, and Mexico in 2011. Prior to switching to its current live format, taped episodes premiered a few hours earlier in Ireland and the United Kingdom and a day earlier in Australia, Canada, Singapore, and Philippines than the United States, due to time differences. For international broadcast listings, see below. The show celebrated its 15th anniversary on October 10, 2014, and the 1000th episode on October 16, 2018. As of March 3, 2017, all archived episodes of the show are available for on demand viewing via the WWE Network. Recent episodes are available for on-demand viewing 30 days after the original air date. WWF SmackDown! was set up to compete against WCW's Thursday night show, Thunder. SmackDown! first appeared on April 29, 1999 using the Raw set as a single television special on UPN. On August 26, 1999, SmackDown! officially debuted on UPN. Like WCW Thunder, SmackDown! was recorded on Tuesdays and then broadcast on Thursdays. The new WWF show was so popular that WCW moved Thunder to Wednesdays so that it would not compete directly. Throughout the show's early existence, The Rock routinely called SmackDown! \"his show\", in reference to the fact that the name was derived from one of his catchphrases, \"Lay the smack down\". In March 2002, WWF implemented the \"brand extension\", under which Raw and SmackDown! would have separate rosters of performers that are exclusive to their respective programs and events, and be positioned in-universe as competing \"brands\" (in a manner reminiscent of athletic conferences). In the 2004\u201305 season, SmackDown had an average viewership of 5. 1 million viewers, making it UPN's second-highest-rated series behind America's Next Top Model. With the cancellation of Star Trek: Enterprise, SmackDown moved into its former timeslot on Friday nights for the 2005\u201306 season, beginning September 9, 2005. WWE subsequently announced that the show would be renamed Friday Night SmackDown! to emphasize the new scheduling. In January 2006, CBS Corporation and Warner Bros. Entertainment announced that UPN and The WB would merge to form a new network known as The CW that fall. As part of the announcement, The CW announced that it would renew Friday Night SmackDown for two more seasons as part of its launch lineup\u2014which focused primarily on the strongest programs of its two predecessors. On September 22, 2006, Friday Night SmackDown! aired its first episode on The CW. The CW declined to renew SmackDown, resulting in the series being picked up in October 2008 by MyNetworkTV\u2014a second new network formed by Fox Entertainment Group, primarily consisting of former UPN and The WB affiliates who were unable to join The CW. Retaining its previous Friday-night time slot, the season premiere of SmackDown on MyNetworkTV was the highest-rated program in the fledgling network's history, with 3. 2 million viewers. On March 20, 2009, SmackDown celebrated its 500th episode. On October 1, 2010, as part of a new deal with NBC Universal, SmackDown moved to Syfy on October 1, 2010, retaining its Friday night timeslot. Prior to this premiere of SmackDown, Michael Cole hosted a \"pre-game\" show. The move saw Syfy paying close to $30 million for the show as opposed to the $20 million paid by its former network MyNetworkTV. During the August 29, 2011 episode of Raw, WWE dissolved the brand extension, thus allowing performers to appear on Raw and SmackDown at any given time without restriction. The October 14, 2011, episode made SmackDown the second-longest-running weekly episodic television series of American television history (behind Raw, which surpassed that mark on August 1, 2005). On January 18, 2013, SmackDown celebrated its 700th episode. On October 10, 2014, SmackDown celebrated its 15-year anniversary. To help celebrate the 15th anniversary, Stephanie McMahon came out first, then Laurinaitis and Long, respectively, the latter of which kept one-upping each other for the main event of the night until McMahon decided to keep the 15-man tag team match that Long suggested, on the condition Laurinaitis and Long be the captains of each team like at WrestleMania XXVIII. Long's team won the match. On December 16, 2014, SmackDown aired a live 800th episode special on Syfy's sister channel USA Network, SuperSmackDown Live!, featuring a main event between Dolph Ziggler and Seth Rollins. In January 2015, SmackDown returned to a Thursday time slot. The return to Thursday nights was expected to help attract a younger audience to Syfy, as well as more premium advertising dollars from marketers, who tend to spend more to promote their products, especially film releases, on the night as consumers head into the weekend. The last SmackDown airing on a Friday night had 2. 43 million viewers with a 0. 7 share. On January 7, 2016, SmackDown moved to USA Network, remaining on Thursday nights. With the move, all top three WWE programs\u2014Raw, SmackDown and Tough Enough\u2014would air on the same network for the first time ever. On May 25, 2016, as part of the re-implementation of the brand extension and split between Raw and SmackDown, it was announced that SmackDown would become a live program on Tuesday nights. On the July 11, 2016 episode of Raw, Vince McMahon named Shane McMahon the commissioner of SmackDown. Then next week on Raw, Daniel Bryan was revealed as the new SmackDown General Manager. On July 22, 2016, General Manager Daniel Bryan revealed the new SmackDown logo on his official Twitter page, renaming the show SmackDown Live. On April 10, 2018, SmackDown Commissioner Shane McMahon announced that Daniel Bryan was back as a full-time WWE wrestler and named Paige the new General Manager. On June 26, 2018, Fox announced a five-year agreement to air SmackDown, in a deal worth $205 million per year. SmackDown would debut on October 4, 2019, with its first episode being the 20th Anniversary special. The episode also marks the return of SmackDown to Friday nights and the return of WWE programming to Fox for the first time since the network aired the November 14, 1992 episode of Saturday Night's Main Event. The agreement came as WWE's previous broadcast deal with USA Network to air both SmackDown and WWE Raw was set to expire, and as Fox has increasingly emphasized live sports programming and non-scripted entertainment in the wake of its then-upcoming sale of its in-house studios to Disney. Fox had hoped to acquire Raw for the Fox network and SmackDown for FS1. However, amid a competitive bidding situation, NBCUniversal focused its efforts on renewing Raw, freeing up Fox to pursue SmackDown. In particular, Fox promised a larger amount of promotion for SmackDown during its sports programming, as well as a WWE-oriented studio show (WWE Backstage) on FS1. Fox began an advertising campaign by Wieden+Kennedy for the move, \"We're All Superstars\", to coincide with the beginning of football season, revealing a new logo and the reinstatement of the Friday Night SmackDown title. Friday Night SmackDown saw huge ratings increase since moving to Fox, adding an extra 1. 6 million from the week before, but also saw a 25% drop the week after to 2. 88 million viewers. The October 25, 2019 episode was moved to FS1 due to Fox airing game 3 of the 2019 World Series. An hour-long version of the episode aired on Fox the following Sunday afternoon. Due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, WWE announced that both SmackDown and Raw would suspend on-location broadcasts, and air from the WWE Performance Center in Orlando with no audience, with SmackDown doing so for the first time on March 13, 2020. The ensuing episode also featured Triple H as a guest commentator, and an encore presentation of the Elimination Chamber match for the SmackDown Tag Team Championship from the titular pay-per-view the previous Sunday. WWE taped SmackDown on Tuesday evenings to air on Thursday evenings on Syfy the same week. However, SmackDown had aired occasional live specials on Tuesday nights (which are then replayed in its usual Thursday night timeslot). The show began broadcasting in HD beginning with the January 25, 2008 episode of SmackDown, where a new set (which became universal for all WWE weekly programming) debuted. Following the first broadcast in HD, the exclamation mark used since the show's inception disappeared from all references pertaining to \"SmackDown\", including the official logo, which resembles the 2001\u20132008 logo, but with a darker blue scheme. The early set included an oval-shaped TitanTron entrance and stage (dubbed the \"Ovaltron\") which made it stand out from the Raw Is War set with its rectangular Titantrons. Later productions gained the ability to move the Ovaltron either to the left or to the right of the stage. In August 2001, as part of celebrating SmackDown! s second anniversary, the show received a new logo and set, which consisted of a fist centered above the entrance with the WWF/E scratch logo above it, and many glass panes along the sides strongly resembling shattered glass with two TitanTrons on each side. From October 26, 2012 until April 4, 2014, SmackDown began using \"Born 2 Run\" by 7Lions as its theme song, with \"This Life\" by CFO$ and Cody B. Ware serving as the secondary theme, then a swap was made, as \"Born 2 Run\" was used as a secondary theme, when \"This Life\" is used as SmackDown's main theme. Prior to October 26, 2012, SmackDown opened with \"Know Your Enemy\" by Green Day while \"Hangman\" by Rev Theory served as the secondary theme song. Upon SmackDowns debut on Syfy in 2010, it replaced the previous theme song \"Let it Roll\" by Divide the Day. As of August 3, 2012, the show has used the modified WWE HD universal set, which debuted at Raw 1000 on July 23. From September 21, 2012 until October 26, 2012, October 4, 2013 until November 1, 2013, October 3 and 31, 2014 and October 2 and 30, 2015, WWE worked in conjunction with Susan G. Komen for the Cure to raise awareness for breast cancer by adorning the SmackDown set with pink ribbons and a special pink middle-rope in the ring. SmackDowns ring ropes were usually blue from 1999 to 2012 (although they were black for a period between 2001 and 2002). They remained blue until December 2012 when they were permanently changed to white, with all WWE programming now using white ring ropes. On August 22, 2014, SmackDown switched to a full 16:9 letterbox presentation, with a down-scaled version of the native HD feed on a 4:3 SD feed. Like Raw (which also switched to a full 16:9 letterbox presentation four days earlier on August 18), the new WWE logo is seen on the ring's turnbuckle covers and also, on the lower right-hand corner of the screen. On August 29, 2014, the Syfy network logo moved to the lower left-hand corner of the screen. Although the graphics were re-positioned, SmackDown continued to use a variation of the graphics package that had been in use since its first HD broadcast in January 2008, until the show moved to Thursday nights on January 15, 2015, when an all-new graphics package (now optimized for the 16:9 format) and intro video were introduced along with a revised SmackDown logo. On March 26, 2015, WWE added a small LED board to the left side of the ring on SmackDown, similar to Raw. On the September 14, 2015 season premiere of Raw, the middle rope was colored gold. Throughout the month of October 2015, the WWE broadcast table, entrance ramp, and ring skirts were co-branded with Susan G. Komen for the cure of breast cancer. Also, the middle ring rope was pink to promote the fight against breast cancer. Following the brand split in 2016, the ropes return to its original blue color as well as debuting a new set. The post brand extension set was almost identical to the TLC: Tables, Ladders and Chairs set from 2009 to 2013 and caused some negative feedback among online fans for re-using an old stage design. A month after the new set debut, a more distinctive and elaborate stage was created for SmackDown. The stage used was a new design with multiple LED side panels on each side with a titan-tron in a semi circle in the center. The new set also introduced LED floor panels on the entrance ramp. Feedback was more positive for this set design. With the shift to Fox, both Raw and SmackDown introduced new sets during their \"premiere week\", and it was also stated that WWE would reinstate the use of pyrotechnics on both shows (after briefly suspending their use in 2017 due to budget concerns), and that both shows will now be staffed by separate writing teams. The new set design consists of the eight circuit board-themed semi-arches with the octagonal screen in the centre along with the giant TitanTron screen on top that pays tribute to the original design in 1999 and the 30 LED side boards. Bold song titles are currently being used as the opening theme. On July 10, 2007, Merriam-Webster included the word smackdown in Webster's Dictionary. The act of knocking down or bringing down an opponent. A contest in entertainment wrestling. A decisive defeat. A confrontation between rivals or competitors. The Oxford English Dictionary traces the use of the word smackdown in English back at least as far as 1990, but notes that a professional wrestling television show \"popularized\" the term. Throughout its broadcast history, the show has aired editions that have different themes. These include tributes to various professional wrestlers who have recently died or retired from actively performing, and episodes commemorating various show milestones or anniversaries. Various on-air personalities appear on the show, including the wrestlers (both men and women), ring announcers, commentators, and on-screen authority figures. SmackDown also has had various recurring on-air segments hosted by members of the roster. Although SmackDown has been the second-largest show in the WWE, the company's use of the term went beyond its namesake program. During the 2000 U.S. election campaign, the WWE launched the SmackDown! Your Vote program. The name was also used when WWE released its 2015 film The Flintstones & WWE: Stone Age SmackDown! and WWE Network's show Kitchen SmackDown! In addition to the Spanish-language Fox Deportes simulcasting with Fox live in the United States and broadcasts to American troops deployed overseas on AFN Sports 2, SmackDown also appears on-air internationally. SmackDown airs live on Fox Sports in Mexico and across Central and South America since 2014. In Mexico, MVS aired SmackDown between 2005 and 2008, and Azteca 7 from 2008 to 2014. In Canada, SmackDown has historically been aired by Sportsnet 360 (SN360, formerly known as The Score), as part of network owner Rogers Media's long-term deal with WWE. The program has historically aired in simulcast with the U.S. airing. During its return to Thursday nights between January 2015 and July 2016, pre-recorded episodes of SmackDown aired on Wednesdays\u2014one night earlier\u2014due to conflicts with the channel's Thursday-night National Hockey League broadcasts. Despite the move to Fox (which is widely carried on Canadian television providers), Rogers has not elected to simulcast SmackDown on its broadcast network Citytv to invoke potential simsub rights. SmackDown airs live in Australia on Saturday late mornings/early afternoons and Sunday afternoons on Fox8 and Friday nights on 9Go! as a one-hour version, and airs live in New Zealand on Sky 5 and Sunday nights on Prime as a one-hour version. SmackDown airs in China on various television networks. SmackDown airs in Fiji on Sky Pacific and Sky Fiji. SmackDown airs live in Pakistan and in Bangladesh, Nepal, Sri Lanka and India on Sony Ten and Kenya on Kenya Broadcasting Corporation.

Starting April 2020, SmackDown airs in Indonesia on Mola TV On-Demand. South Africa on SuperSport, and Samoa on SBC. SmackDown airs in the Middle East and North Africa on OSN, and Israel on 5LIVE. It also airs on FM1 (Previously Iran FM-TV) in Iran. In South Africa, SmackDown was previously broadcast by free-to-air broadcaster e.tv. The show would play on Wednesday nights in the evening, with a 7-day delay, edited to one hour and was one of the most watched programs on the channel. However, in 2017 e.tv decided not to renew its broadcasting deal with WWE. The rights were later resold to SuperSport (the initial broadcasters of WWE programming) who broadcast the show across Sub-Saharan Africa, live and uncut. In 2019 SuperSport, along with its parent company Multichoice, signed a deal to broadcast the 24-hour WWE channel as a pop-up channel for five months on their DStv platform. Currently there are announcements made by DStv that the channel could be made permanent on the platform. The series airs live in the United Kingdom and Ireland on BT Sport as of January 2020.

The series airs in France on AB1 and in Italy on Sky Sport Uno and Sky Sport Arena, with international version of one-hour shows airing on Cielo in Italy in Italian. SmackDown airs in Germany every Saturday at 10:00 pm on ProSieben MAXX. In Poland the full show on Extreme Sports Channel airs three days late. In Portugal the full two-hour episode airs on SportTV 5 on Wednesdays at 7:00pm and a one-hour version airs on SportTV+ on Saturday mornings at 11:00am.

On September 24, 2012, Hulu signed a multi-year deal with WWE to stream all of the company's TV shows and some of its web series, which includes SmackDown. Full episodes of SmackDown are available for viewing the following day of its original airing. All previous episodes of SmackDown are available on the WWE Network, where recent episodes are available for on-demand viewing 30 days after the original air date.\n",

        "reference": " Comics superheroes entering the 1950s and facing the advent of McCarthyism. The series opens by showing how various Golden Age heroes have adjusted to life after World War II. The members of the Justice Society of America and All-Star Squadron have mostly retired. Tex Thompson, formerly known as the Americommando and Mr. America, has returned from Europe a war hero and has used his fame to start a political career, resulting in him being elected a senator. He then recruits several former heroes to create a new group of heroes for the 1950s. The group includes Robotman (who is slowly losing touch with his humanity), the Atom and Johnny Thunder (who are both looking for somewhere to belong), and Dan the Dyna-Mite (Daniel Dunbar), who is lost after the death of his mentor TNT. Thompson oversees various experiments on Dunbar which change him into the incredibly powerful Dynaman. Other retired heroes are suffering from their own problems. The McCarthy hearings have resulted in Green Lantern being blacklisted due to his job as the head of a media corporation. Johnny Quick and Liberty Belle were married and eventually divorced. Quick is now a television reporter while Belle is dating journalist John Law (formerly the Tarantula). Starman has suffered a nervous breakdown after realizing that his research into cosmic energy helped in the development of the atom bomb. Captain Triumph (Lance Gallant) has retired and is trying to lead a normal life, despite his twin brother Michael's ghost urging him to become a hero again. Hourman is fighting his addiction to the Miraclo pill that gives him his powers. The hero Manhunter (Paul Kirk), who has also returned from Europe, is suffering from memory loss and being hunted by strange men. He meets up with Thompson's former sidekick from his Mr. America days, Bob Daley AKA Fatman, and hides out while coming to terms with his demons. Eventually, the two of them seek the help of Hawkman, who helps Manhunter regain his memories. Those memories reveal a dark secret about Thompson: During the final days of the war, the super-villain known as the Ultra-Humanite, who worked as one of Hitler's scientists at Dachau, transferred his brain into Thompson's body. While Manhunter is recovering his memories, Thompson's aide and lover Joan Dale, the former Miss America discovers his personal diary. Concerned with Thompson and Dunbar's increasingly strange behavior, she enlists former thief Paula Brooks, also known as the Tigress, to pick the lock and open the diary. The two of them, along with Gallant (whom Brooks was dating), discover not only that Thompson is actually the Ultra-Humanite, but also that he had performed another brain swap, that of Adolf Hitler's brain into Dunbar's body. They call Johnny Quick to inform him about the contents of the diary at about the same time Carter Hall calls him about Manhunter's revelations. This sets the stage for an explosive and tragic final showdown in Washington, D.C.. As Miss America attempts to reveal the truth about Tex Thompson and Dynaman before the assembled heroes, she is murdered by Robotman, who knew but didn't care about Tex and Dynaman's secrets. The Atom is finally convinced by Hourman that Tex and Dynaman are evil. Johnny Thunder, still brainwashed by Thompson's \"dream\" and blinded by his desire to belong somewhere, orders Yz, his thunderbolt, to kill Hourman. Yz attempts to obey the command but is so torn between his duties to his master and his own moral standards that he suffers a breakdown and flies, screaming, into the heavens (presumably forever) leaving Thunder guilt-ridden. Dynaman admits the truth about himself and proceeds to kill several heroes, including Tarantula, Human Bomb, Sportsmaster (a reformed villain), Doll Man and Red Bee, as well as disabling Doctor Mid-Nite by destroying his goggles and Hawkman by tearing off his wings. Thompson battles Manhunter, who snaps Thompson's neck after both of them fall out of a window. Lance Gallant and Robotman fight and kill each other. Dynaman is killed when Liberty Belle rams what is left of Starman's cosmic rod through his chest. She is able to do this after Dynaman is distracted by Adam Blake AKA Captain Comet, a young hero who joins the others in the fighting. Despite numerous injuries and deaths, the heroes are triumphant. The last pages show Manhunter recovering and returning to Africa (he disappeared in 1951); Paula returns to a life of crime after being driven over the edge at witnessing Lance's death; Ted Knight recovers and marries; Al Pratt grows more mature after the incident, in contrast to Johnny Thunder who \"never changed\", and Johnny Quick and Liberty Belle reconcile. Meanwhile, a new generation of superheroes, led by Captain Comet, is born and Quick looks forward to \"a new age, as pure as sterling silver\". The last page is a splash page showing Captain Comet and various other Silver Age heroes including Martian Manhunter (hovering behind his human identity John Jones), the Challengers of the Unknown, the Doom Patrol, Green Arrow, Elongated Man, Aquaman, Adam Strange, Animal Man,  The Creeper, and Metamorpho, as well as successors such as Hal Jordan (Alan Scott's successor as Green Lantern), Ray Palmer (Al Pratt's successor as The Atom), Cliff Steele (Robert Crane's successor as Robotman and a member of the Doom Patrol), and Barry Allen (Jay Garrick's successor as The Flash). The Golden Age takes place outside normal DC universe continuity and is labeled as an \"Elseworlds\". Despite this, writer James Robinson incorporated elements of the series into his Starman series. Additionally, some elements of the mini-series were used by writer Geoff Johns in a JSA story arc, bringing some elements of this story into continuity (including Starman helping to develop the atom bomb, the McCarthy hearings blacklisting the JSA\u2014though a variation of this appeared in the final issue of the Justice Society's run in Adventure Comics in 1979). The most notable elements that are out of continuity are the fates of Dan the Dyna-Mite (who in DC continuity became a member of \"Old Justice\", a team that fought Young Justice), Tarantula (who has appeared in the pages of Nightwing) and Miss America (who appears in Freedom Fighters series). The series was collected as a trade paperback () in 1995. A new printing of this trade paperback was published in 2005, with the book retitled as JSA: The Golden Age (). Writer Geoff Johns credits James Robinson's work on this book for igniting his love for the characters in it, and for his decision to accept writing duties on JSA in 2000.\n",

Yasuj is an industrial city in the Zagros Mountains of southwestern Iran. The term Yasuj is also used to refer to the entire region. Yasuj has both a sugar processing plant and a coal-burning powerplant that generates electricity for the area. The people of Yasuj speak the Luri language. The area of Yasuj has been settled since as early as the Bronze Age. Findings include the Martyrs Hills (dating from 3rd millennium BC), the Khosravi Hill from the Achaemenian period, the ancient site of Gerd, the Pataveh bridge, and the Pay-e Chol cemetery. Yasuj is the place where Alexander III of Macedon and his Macedonian forces stormed the Persian Gates (Darvazeh-ye Fars), and found a way into the Persian heartland (331 BC). The Yasuj Museum, which opened in 2002, displays coins, statues, pottery, and bronze vessels recovered from surrounding archaeological sites. Yasuj was called Tal-e Khosrow (Khosrow Hill) in the last century. Yasuj has the typical continentally-influenced Mediterranean climate (K\u00f6ppen Csa) of western Iran, though because of its location in the direct line of rain-bearing winds from the Persian Gulf it is the wettest Iranian city south of the Elburz Mountains with an annual rainfall nine times that of Isfahan and twice that of Kermanshah. The heavy precipitation allows the existence of small glaciers on the highest Zagros peaks \u2013 in contrast the Kuhrud Mountains to the east have no glaciers despite being of the same height due to aridity. The long dry season sees only on average  of rainfall between June and September, with the wet season extending into October, unlike many other mediterranean climates. By 2014 a new refinery will be constructed by the private sector, at a cost of $2. 2 billion. It will produce petrol, gasoil, kerosene, furnace oil, liquefied gas, asphalt, and sulfur.\n",

The important alpine long-distance hiking Peace Trail (Sentiero della Pace) also leads over the top of the Altissimo. Besides the mountain hut, there are also leftover military installations from World War I and a chapel for remembrance to the wars victims.\n",

        "reference": " It was named after the Cr\u00e9teil Abbey, as most gatherings took place in that suburb of Paris. In 1905 and early 1906 a group of young artists and poets holding meetings at various locations found that society, the way it was organized, did not take into consideration an environment needed for creative expression, nor the goals it proposed. Founded officially in the autumn of 1906 by the painter Albert Gleizes, and the poets,, Alexandre Mercereau and Charles Vildrac, L'Abbaye de Cr\u00e9teil was a phalanst\u00e8re, a utopian community. The movement drew its inspiration from the Abbaye de Th\u00e9l\u00e8me, a fictional creation by Rabelais in his novel Gargantua. It was closed down by its members early in 1908. Georges Duhamel and Vildrac settled in Cr\u00e9teil, just to the southeast of Paris, in a house in a park-like setting along the Marne River. Their aim was to establish a place of freedom and friendship favourable for artistic and literary creativity. Henri-Martin Barzun (father of the historian and cultural critic Jacques Barzun) was a financial contributor to his friends at the Abbaye de Cr\u00e9teil. In an unpublished part of his Souvenirs Gleizes wrote that an initial idea for the Abbaye of Cr\u00e9teil was to escape from corrupt Western civilization to the simplicity of life in the South Seas, as he then believed Gauguin had done. The group tried to create a publishing house that would bring in sufficient income to support the Abbaye. The typographer, a friend of Albert Gleizes, furnished the printing press. From January 1907 through January 1908, some twenty books were published by the Abbaye. Barzun, more sophisticated than the other idealists of the Abbaye, introduced Gleizes to the specific history of Utopian socialism. Though Gleizes did not enter the Abbaye with a specific program in mind. The art historian Daniel Robbins is responsible for laying out the filiation between the Paul Fort's Vers et Prose, the Abbaye, post-Symbolist writers and politically engaged aesthetic thinking that would lead Gleizes to Cubism. Robbin's pioneering work brought the history of the Abbaye to an Anglo-American readership. He characterized their endeavors as a'search for a synthetic modern art' that gave expression to social ideas. A synthetic view of the universe, presenting the remarkable phenomena of time and space, multiplicity and diversity, at once was his painted equivalent to the ideals which were verbally realized in the Abbaye poetry. Many artists visited the community and participated in its project, including the poet Pierre Jean Jouve; the musician ; the illustrator ; the painter ;, who had translated American poet Walt Whitman's Leaves of Grass into French; and the writer Jules Romains, founder of unanimism. The fame of the Abbaye circulated even in Moscow, attracting many artists along the way. Filippo Tommaso Marinetti and Constantin Br\u00e2ncu\u0219i were visitors there and young writers like Roger Allard (one of the first to defend Cubism), Pierre Jean Jouve, and Paul Castiaux are some of the artists who wanted to publish their works through the Abbaye. The Abbaye group, in principle supporting themselves through the communal work of publishing, were supported by many Symbolists. Yet its members soon began to break with the art forms practiced by the respected older generation. Like many Symbolists, the Abbaye artists \"scorned the structure of a bourgeois world and sought to substitute a communal society\", writes Robbins, \"but they did not reject the themes of modern life in favor of the Symbolist focus on single elements and internal, individual images\". They wished instead \"to create an epic and heroic art, stripped of ornament and obscure allegory\", Robbins continues, \"an art dealing with the relevant subjects of modern life: crowds, man and machines, even, ultimately, the city itself\". The intentions of the Abbaye were vast and would ultimately remain unfulfilled. Their goal, like that of the Symbolists before them, was equivalent to an escape from reality. \"Yet there were important distinctions\", write Robbins, \"for the Abbaye intention to create a total future a priori ruled out the Symbolist technique of creating solely from an aesthetic or a closed ideal\". The Abbaye attracted much interest but little revenue and its young members found themselves forced to close their beloved Abbaye on January 28, 1908. Its publishing house survived for a while and the friends continued to gather every month for a d\u00eener des copains (in French, \"dinner of pals\"). Shortly after its dissolution, Gleizes moved to 7 rue du Delta near Montmartre, Paris, with artists, Amedeo Modigliani, Maurice Drouart and Geo Printemps. Marcel Lenoir (pseudo.\n",

SACOM monitors and publicizes the misconducts of multinational corporations (e.g. Apple Inc., Disney) through first-hand investigations in supplier factories. In August 2005, SACOM launched the debut campaign called Looking For Mickey Mouse's Conscience amid the opening of Hong Kong Disneyland. It aimed to advocate conscience consumption against sweatshop products such as Disney toys and gifts. SACOM's follow-up investigations exposed the frequent labour rights violations in Disney's supplier factories, and there has been little improvement over years. In August 2009, SACOM and Stop Toying Around jointly published the report titled Exploitations of Toy Factory Workers at the Bottom of Global Supply Chain. The report highlighted the poor working conditions within Chinese supplier factories of famous brands such as Disney, Mattel and Walmart. These factories adopted the ICTI Care Process, a so-called ethical manufacturing certification programme. It was found that the certification process non-transparent and unaccountable to the public, workers and civil society, becoming a de facto cover for labour rights infringement for global toy brands. In January 2012, SACOM released its investigative findings regarding to the production of Wenlock and Mandeville, the official mascots of 2012 London Olympics and Paralympics, and pointed out the production process violated the Sustainable Sourcing Code of London Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games (LOCOG). In 2010, SACOM launched investigative reports on Apple in response to the serial suicides in Foxconn  and the mass n-hexane poisoning in Wintek (Suzhou), both of which are Apple's major suppliers. SACOM urged Apple to take responsibility for the poisoning and suicides, for its ethical codes were violated in the production of iPhones and iPads. Subsequent investigations of SACOM in Apple's Chinese supplier factories made the shocking discoveries that Foxconn treated its workers as machines and enforced military management. In February 2011, SACOM released the report Game console and music player production in China jointly with makeITfair\u201d\u2019,\u201cSOMO\u201d and \u201cFinnwatch\u201d, which investigated the supplier factories of Apple, Microsoft, Motorola, Phillips and Sony. The study revealed that their workers\u2019 working hours exceeded the statutory limit while being paid far below the living wage. In addition, the workers were unable to form genuine unions  to protect their own rights. In December 2005, SACOM's report on Giordano revealed the alleged labour right abuses in its supplier factories, and demanded Giordano to fulfill its monitoring responsibilities. In July 2012, SACOM jointly published the investigation results with IHLO Hong Kong Liaison Office, War on Want (WoW) and Clean Clothes Campaign (CCC) concerning the use of sandblasting for distressing jeans, which can cause workers fatal silicosis disease. Sandblasting was found to be still commonly used in the Chinese suppliers of Western brands including Abercrombie & Fitch and H&M, despite many brands announced during 2010-2011 to ban the practice. SACOM supported the Coke Concerned Student Group in Mainland China, which aims to improve the working conditions of bottling plants in China. SACOM also collaborated with other Hong Kong NGOs to train the employees of all levels in two HP supplier factories in Dongguan, China, to enhance their understanding of labour rights.\n",

        "prefix": "The Cathedral of the Blessed Sacrament (popularly known as the Christchurch Basilica) is located in the city centre of Christchurch, New Zealand. It is",
        "reference": " the mother church of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Christchurch and seat of the Bishop of Christchurch, currently Bishop Paul Martin SM. Designed by architect Francis Petre, it is generally held to be the finest renaissance-style building in New Zealand. On 7 April 1983, the building was registered as a Category I heritage item by the New Zealand Historic Places Trust, with the registration number 47. It is regarded as an outstanding example of church architecture in Australasia, and is regarded as Petre's best design. The Cathedral was closed after the 4 September 2010 Canterbury earthquake. The February 2011 Christchurch earthquake collapsed the two bell towers at the front of the building and destabilised the dome. The dome was removed and the rear of the Cathedral was demolished. The decision to demolish the church was made public on 4 August 2019. On 7 December 2019, Bishop Martin announced that a new $85 million Catholic cathedral was to be completed by 2025 and would accommodate up to 1,000 people. It would be built adjacent to Victoria Square. A  by  wooden chapel was built on Barbadoes Street, south east of the city centre, in October 1860 for newly arrived Marist missionary priests. This chapel was replaced by a larger wooden church designed by Benjamin Mountfort in 1864, which was expanded over the years. This building was designated the Pro Cathedral of the newly established Diocese of Christchurch in 1887 by Bishop John Grimes S.M., the first Catholic bishop of Christchurch. This designation indicated that the bishop was planning  a new Cathedral from the beginning of his tenure. The old building was considered inadequate for the growing population still confined to one city church. In May 1897 Grimes went to Rome for his ad limina visit. He had several audiences with Pope Leo XIII who gave two gifts for the project. One was a valuable cameo and the other a richly enamelled portrait of the Pope both of which were later sold in a fund-raising bazaar. During his 18 months overseas Grimes travelled in England, Ireland, France, Belgium, and on the return journey, via the Canadian Pacific Railway, in the United States and Canada. Wherever he could command an invitation he preached and begged for his Cathedral, nine times on one Sunday in New York. He arrived back in Christchurch on 10 January 1899 with more than \u00a33,000 for his Cathedral fund (including \u00a3800 collected in Ireland). At that time Wellington's Sacred Heart Basilica was under construction with Petre as architect in a branch office there. It is likely that it was in Wellington that Grimes invited Petre to submit a plan for the Christchurch Cathedral. Petre proposed the form of the Cathedral. He wrote later that the Roman basilica style was chosen because \". the proportion of height to length and breadth in the Gothic building is nearly three times that of the Basilica. In fact if a Gothic church were drawn with the width of nave shown in my drawings it would be higher than any Gothic church in the world\". Gothic was also considered the greater earthquake risk and overall the more expensive. Grimes had the old church removed to Ferry Road and construction of a new cathedral began in 1901. Massive efforts began to raise money for the building. Grimes engaged in constant tours of his diocese to raise the cash. Problems with finding suitable stone for the construction of such a large structure caused financial difficulties during the construction, and a special Act was pushed through Parliament by then Premier Richard Seddon in order to aid with the financing of the building. The constant need to find money and to build cheaply led to strained relations between the Bishop and the architect. The Catholic community with under 5,000 wage and salary earners in a total Catholic community of 20,570, was fewer in number and overall less advantaged than the Anglican community (whose cathedral took 50 years to build and opened in 1904 at a probable cost of more than \u00a360,000 with a residual debt of \u00a34,000). It \"speaks volumes for the value average Catholic placed on their faith\" that such small numbers enabled the completion of their Cathedral at a total cost of \u00a352,000 with a final debt (10 years after it opened) of less than \u00a35,000. Grimes said at the opening on 12 February 1905, a mere four years after construction began: \"No one can claim that our stately Cathedral is the work of the wealthy. It is the fruit of the hard earnings of the poor and the lowly, generous to a sacrifice of their well-won pounds, their shillings and their pence\". The Cathedral was built by Jamieson and Sons who built many other major ecclesiastical and municipal buildings in New Zealand. Petre had previous experience in using concrete, designing dock walls and sewers as a draughtsman. This knowledge allowed Petre to require innovative methods during construction such as pouring heart walls with concrete and then facing with stone. Mass-produced components were widely used, including curved arches made in a purpose built moulding machine. Fifty men were employed on the site, and in excess of 120,000 cubic ft (3400 m\u00b3) of stone, 4,000 cubic ft (110 m\u00b3) of concrete, and 90 tons of steel were used in the construction. After its completion the Cathedral, constructed of concrete sheathed in Oamaru limestone, was widely acclaimed, later causing George Bernard Shaw to describe Petre as a \"New Zealand Brunelleschi\". Forsaking 19th-century Gothic, Petre designed the new church in a Renaissance, Italian basilica style, with one major exception. Ignoring Renaissance convention, Petre obtained a greater visual impact by siting the Italianate green copper-roofed dome not above the cross section of the church (as in St. Peter's Basilica in Rome), but directly above the sanctuary. In Petre's opinion, this design element, coupled with the Byzantine apse, added extra grandeur and theatre to the high altar set in the tribune. The nave and chancel roofs were supported by colonnades of Ionic columns and the entrance fa\u00e7ade of the cathedral was flanked by twin towers in the manner of many of Europe's great renaissance churches. While often likened, at least in its outward form, to St Paul's Cathedral in London, it is conceivable that the greatest influence behind this structure was Benoit Haffreingue. During Petre's formative years, Haffreingue had been the driving force of the reconstruction of the Cathedral of Notre Dame in Boulogne-sur-Mer, a French church that has a very similar plan to that of the Cathedral of the Blessed Sacrament, including the controversial siting of the dome over the altar rather than the centre of the cathedral. Haffreingue was also the principal of a private Jesuit boarding school for boys (now known as \"Le coll\u00e8ge Haffreingue-Chanclaire\") in Boulogne-sur-Mer. Petre  was a student at this school in 1860-186, during Heffreingue's tenure. The building was also said by some to be based on the 19th-century Church of Saint-Vincent-de-Paul, Paris to which it bore some striking similarities. The similarities to another great French church, Saint-Sulpice, Paris (17th century) have also been remarked upon. One commentator said that the exterior of the Cathedral was probably the most complete and consistent of all Petre's churches. \"The majesty of the dome was best seen from the rear, and from most parts of the city it registered powerfully above the Christchurch flatness in a manner reminiscent of Brunelleschi's dome in Florence\". George Bernard Shaw during his 1934 visit was unimpressed with Gilbert Scott's Anglican cathedral but generous in his praise of Petre's Catholic one. \"In fact it was Shaw who was one of the first to open local eyes to the quality of this building\". In 1970 under Bishop Ashby, \"years of grime deposited from the [then] nearby railway station and gasworks were cleaned off and restoration work was carried out\". \"The great joy of the cathedral, however, is the interior. Petre's handling of natural light is as sure as ever, the nave and sanctuary are suffused with daylight. The fine Corinthian and Ionic columns down each side of the nave are a development of the design of St Patrick's Basilica, Oamaru, here doubled in height, for obviously single columns in this great nave would have required enormous girth. The sanctuary dome is undoubtedly the climax of the interior; it is here that the full power of the design is unleashed. This was Petre's finest achievement in forty years of practice. Fascinating vistas are gained through the arches which transmit the enormous weight of the dome to the four massive piers. These are decorated with subtle flutings, a fresh variation on an ancient theme. In this sanctuary the liturgy can be seen as drama and it receives a fitting setting for its movement and colour\". The 2010 Canterbury earthquake, a Richter magnitude 7. 1 earthquake on 4 September 2010, resulted in the closure of the Cathedral to the public indefinitely, to allow for seismic strengthening and restoration. Masses were not celebrated at the Cathedral from the September earthquake, but took place at other nearby locations such as the chapel of the adjacent Music Centre. However, although his Requiem Mass was celebrated at St Mary's Pro-Cathedral, Bishop Cunneen was buried in the Cathedral. A Richter magnitude 6. 3 earthquake on 22 February 2011 caused considerable damage to the Cathedral. The Cathedral administrator, Monsignor Charles Drennan, said that engineers had indicated that it was unlikely the building could be saved. The two bell towers at the front of the building collapsed, bringing much of the front fa\u00e7ade down with them, with large blocks of masonry destroying vehicles in front of the building. There was also major cracking evident around the Cathedral's main dome. Stained glass windows, which had survived the 4 September earthquake and some 4,000 aftershocks, were also \"in ruins\". Monsignor Drennan said that workers repairing damage to the building caused by the earlier earthquake, escaped, as did a custodian who was in the Cathedral at the time. Drennan told Kim Hill in a National Radio interview on 5 March that the screams of the children at the nearby school when the earthquake struck at nine minutes to one \"will stay with him for a long time\". He and other priests were having lunch when the violent shaking started and they dived under the table from where one of them watched the towers falling from the Cathedral. The building has been described as \"quite humbled\". On the collapsed front, \"all that was left at the top was a cross piercing the sky \u2013 two angels abreast keeping vigil\". Msgr Drennan and three other priests were forced to evacuate the Cathedral Rectory by authorities. This was not because of any damage to that building, but because authorities wanted to clear the central city area of people for security reasons. Adjoining parts of Catholic Cathedral College were threatened by the severely damaged Cathedral and the college had to shift to St Thomas of Canterbury College under a \"site-sharing\" arrangement. On 2 March, Bishop Jones decided that the dome of the Cathedral would be removed after an inspection revealed another large earthquake could topple it completely. An engineer's report showed that the Cathedral's dome was forcing weight-bearing structures outwards and that another earthquake like the magnitude 6. 3 on 22 February would topple the dome. The Bishop said that the removal of the dome would begin as soon as possible, but other work had to be completed and equipment assembled before work could begin. The removal of the dome would be done by cranes at a distance from the site because of the risk of collapse. The Bishop also said that no decisions would be made about the future of the building until a detailed engineering report was generated after the dome has been removed. Until the February earthquake, Masses were being held at the Catholic Cathedral College assembly hall near the Cathedral, but the Bishop said he did not know where future services would be held. He said: \"We don't know anything, all we're concerned about now is protecting human life\". On 5 March, the Minister of Earthquake Recovery, Gerry Brownlee, told a media briefing that if he had his way, most of Christchurch's heritage buildings would be demolished but that he would like to see resources go into rebuilding the ChristChurch Cathedral, the Catholic Basilica, the Canterbury Provincial Chambers and the Christchurch Arts Centre \u2013 \"but that's it \u2013 There will be a few others perhaps, but those would be the most iconic buildings that Christchurch residents would want to see rebuilt. They won't be put back the way they were. They will need to have a great deal of strengthening put into them and it will be quite a long consideration as to how those things might be done\". After the June 2011 Christchurch earthquake, the dome of the Cathedral was removed. The outer copper dome was cut into segments and was finally removed on 26 July and the internal decorative dome was removed intact in August. The damaged rear of the Cathedral was demolished to a low level in October. Meanwhile, in August, Catholic Cathedral College was able to reoccupy its buildings. A statue of the Virgin Mary that was in the north tower of the Cathedral turned 180 degrees during the February earthquake so that instead of facing into the Cathedral it was facing  out. It became a quake survival symbol after the about face as it looked out of a tower window over the battered city. On 29 May 2011 the statue was carried around the damaged Cathedral, once again the centrepiece for a religious ceremony. After circumnavigating the Cathedral grounds, the 200-strong congregation witnessed the Bishop of Christchurch consecrating the city of Christchurch to Mary. The statue had been damaged while being removed from the tower, but was repaired by Carmelite nuns in time for the procession, which was organised by the Sons of the Most Holy Redeemer. Full restoration of the Cathedral was expected to cost more than $100 million and construction of a new Cathedral $40 million. Meanwhile, the decision to demolish the Anglican Cathedral had caused great controversy. One commentator asked why there is \"relative silence over the future of the Basilica for the Catholics who are allowed to get on with their decision-making processes in relative peace, while the Anglicans have to fight it out in the streets and letters to the editor pages of The Press? I suspect there remains in Christchurch the notion of old that the Catholics are still regarded as peripheral, parked over on the edge of town in an area back in the day that was next to the gas works that turned the cathedral a nicotine yellow. Now the distance from the heart of the city seems to have at last paid off as the Basilica's counterpart in the Square can't get out of the ring\". By 7 May 2012, the Catholic Diocese had spent about $3 million deconstructing the damaged parts of the Cathedral, on cleaning and saving and numbering stones, windows and unique elements, and on transporting material, at night, to a storage facility in west Christchurch. The facility and shrink-wrapping allowed the individually numbered objects to be kept in the \"best condition possible\" with a view to their use in any rebuild or as a guide for the design of new elements. The Cathedral's fate was considered in the context of a total of 20 damaged churches in the Christchurch Catholic Diocese. The Diocese also had to deal with insurance issues and decisions on other assets, which included schools, retirement villages, church halls and presbyteries, as well as churches. In May 2015, it was announced that further deconstruction of the front and sanctuary areas of the building would be undertaken with a view to investigating the retention of the nave area (which appeared to be relatively undamaged) and its incorporation into a new building. This redevelopment, if it proceeded, would cost about $45 million and take four years to complete. In October 2016, the result of this investigation was announced. The Cathedral could be saved and gradually rebuilt, but at a cost $100 million. The final decision on the future of the building was to be made by the new Bishop of Christchurch, Paul Martin, appointed in 2018. On 4 August 2019, Bishop Paul Martin announced that the cathedral of the Blessed Sacrament would be demolished. The then current cost of a complete reconstruction of the cathedral was $149 million. The option of just saving the nave and rebuilding on a modest scale was estimated to cost in excess of $91 million. The bishop said that these costs were not bearable by the diocese. He said that the diocese had spent millions of dollars investigating the site and the building and had examined more than 20 different possibilities, but ultimately \"a functional and financial solution\" could not be found and the 113-year-old earthquake-damaged basilica would therefore be demolished. On Saturday 7 December 2019, Bishop Martin announced that a new $85 million Catholic cathedral to be completed by 2025 and accommodating up to 1,000 people would be built adjacent to Victoria Square. The project would also include a hotel precinct of up to four hotels, a relocated St Mary's Primary School, multi-storey car park building, hub for community activities, church offices and residential accommodation for clergy. Payment for the development would include $45m from the church's quake insurance claim for a cathedral. The bishop said that  the \"sizeable\" funding shortfall would be met through fundraising and the sale of excess property and assets, including potentially selling the old Barbadoes St site. The search for potential architects and designs would begin in 2020. John Joseph Grimes SM, First Catholic Bishop of Christchurch. Edward Joyce, Fourth Catholic Bishop of Christchurch.

        "prefix": "The Financial Sanctions Unit of the Bank of England formerly administered financial sanctions in the United Kingdom on behalf of HM Treasury. It was in operation since before 1993,",
        "reference": " when it applied sanctions against the Government of Libya. More recently, since Libya became an ally of the United Kingdom, sanctions have been applied against those who allegedly fought against the Government of Libya at the time it was not an ally (see Incidents which have involved the Financial Sanctions Unit). Responsibility for the administration of Financial Sanctions in the UK transferred from the Bank of England to HM Treasury on 24 October 2007. In April 2016 HM Treasury set up the Office of Financial Sanctions Implementation, a new body whose mission is to \"provide a high-quality service to the private sector, working closely with law enforcement to help ensure that financial sanctions are properly understood, implemented and enforced\". Financial sanctions have established under a multitude of regimes, from UN Security Council Committee Established Pursuant to Resolution 1267 (1999) Concerning Al-Qaida and the Taliban and Associated Individuals and Entities, to EC Commission Regulations, to UK Government orders enforcing trade restrictions against activities in particular countries. Often these authorities overlap so that the same candidates for sanctions are listed from different sources. Aside from the Al-Qaida and the Taliban regimes, there are sanctions regimes against persons associated with Belarus, Burma, Democratic Republic of the Congo, the former Yugoslavia, Iraq, Ivory Coast, Lebanon, Syria, Liberia, Sudan and Zimbabwe. Previous regimes, which have been lifted, involved Angola, Haiti and Libya. Many of these measures targeting terrorist organizations have been subsumed into the general provisions of an order which came into force on 12 October 2006, the day after it was laid before Parliament. The new order allows for  HM Treasury to target anyone they suspect may be attempting to participate in the commissions of acts of terrorism, and anyone who works on their behalf. This includes by default all those identified by the Security Council committee. The main instrument for administering the financial sanctions is the publication of a Consolidated list of financial sanctions targets which can be used by banks and other financial institutions to scan their customer databases and discover financial assets controlled by those who are the targets of the sanctions. The Charity Commission also has powers to freeze the bank accounts of organizations that are registered charities that it suspects are connected with terrorism. Financial sanctions regimes are usually passed as secondary legislation on the basis of an earlier Act of Parliament. There are statements made about the process in Parliament, but no sign of an official debate. The power to impose sanctions against suspects designated by the United Nations Security Council is derived from the United Nations Act 1946, and so is not thought to require further approval. The Chancellor of the Exchequer, Gordon Brown, takes an interest in financial sanctions policy against terrorism, and has made it the subject of major speeches. On 12 October 2006, he announced the broadening of the law to allow for financial sanctions to apply without the need of a UN or EU mandate, and solely on the basis of secret intelligence. He called his department's handling of the 19 suspects involved in the 2006 transatlantic aircraft plot \"the most expeditious and most comprehensive asset freeze the Treasury has undertaken\", and claims that \"since September 11th almost 200 accounts have been frozen linked to over 100 organisations with suspected connections to Al Qaeda\". These were handled as part of the previous regime, by designating those individuals as being connected with Al-Qaeda, without any evidence presented to the public beyond a press release. Several of the targeted people have brought their case before the Court of First Instance on the basis that the measures infringe fundamental principles of Community law (such as European Convention on Human Rights which ensures the right of fair trial, and no punishment without law). the Court. recognise[s] that freezing of funds constitutes a particularly drastic measure, but adds that that measure does not prevent the individuals concerned from leading a satisfactory personal, family and social life, given the circumstances. In particular, they are not forbidden to carry on a trade or business activity, it being however understood that the receipt of income from that activity is regulated. Since the order gives HM Treasury the right to grant licenses which create exemptions to any imposed regime. Libyan Islamic Fighting Group - Sanctions applied on 7 February 2006 against five Libyans residing in the UK on the basis of incidents that occurred in the 1990s. 2006 transatlantic aircraft plot - All 19 suspects became targets of financial sanctions at the time of their arrest, thus revealing their identities. The Chancellor of the Exchequer called it \"the most expeditious and most comprehensive asset freeze the Treasury has undertaken\".\n",

The breed got its name Monk from a colored cap on its head, and Cross from the colored tail and colored primary wing feathers, which resemble a cross during the pigeon's flight. The rest of the feathering is white. Pigeons of this breed have a perfect body posture, a lordly air and a high carriage. The breed is substantial and viable. The birds have a specific feathering pattern, where the colored feathering can be black, red, yellow, coffee-brown, ash-grey, light blue or silver; the coloring must be deep and even. Birds are of medium size, have a round, narrow dry elongated high forehead. They have eyes of medium size, which are lively and expressive with a white or pearl iris and a dark pupil. The average length of the beak is 15\u201317\u00a0mm. The neck is of medium length (if compared with the thin head), and smoothly descends to the chest and back; on the back side of the neck there is a crest which is a part of the forelock. The back is elongated and recedes towards the tail. The chest is relatively wide. The tail is flat, long, narrow and consists of 12 feathers. This breed has light-red unfledged legs of medium length. A characteristic feature of this breed is a high, tight, conchiform forelock, which reaches to the crest on the back, and curls on the end of the forelock which descend to the ears. These birds are medium-billed tumblers. The distinctive flight pattern of German Nuns is a low, circular soar, which usually doesn't last long. Among Nuns there are \"racers\": if these see an alien pigeon when sitting on the roof, they immediately take off and by clapping their wings start to \"invite\" that pigeon to their pigeon-loft. Easy to keep, prolific and good at nursing nestlings.\n",

The school was founded in 1874 by nine men and women who were prominent citizens of Manchester: it was first established in Chorlton on Medlock. A new school was built in Dover Street in 1881. (The building is now occupied by the University of Manchester School of Chemistry). The founding group included Prof Augustus Samuel Wilkins, Harriet, Robert Dukinfield Darbishire and Edward Donner (afterwards Sir Edward Donner, Bart. ) The first headmistress was Elizabeth Day. Day was replaced as head by Sara Annie Burstall in 1898. In September 1939 the school was evacuated to Cheadle Hulme and by 1940 a new school building was under construction at Fallowfield. The unfinished buildings at the Grangethorpe Road site were destroyed by bombing on 20 December 1940. In 1941 the school moved temporarily to Didsbury and by 1949 a new building at Grangethorpe Road began to be occupied. The move into the new school was complete by 1952. The Grangethorpe site was occupied by a large private house and gardens from 1882 to 1936. Manchester High School for Girls has a Preparatory Department for girls aged 4 to 11 with the majority progressing into the Senior School. Prep pupils have an infant section, two assembly halls and a playground and gardens. There are also specially designated areas for Mathematics and Science, a music room, library and two computer-suites providing multi-media facilities. In 2006, the school introduced the teaching of Mandarin to girls in Years 3 and 4. Manchester High's curriculum includes traditional disciplines such as Latin. Pupils are also tutored in areas such as Mathematics, Sciences and Art and Design Technology. MHSG is a multi-cultural school embracing many faiths. Assemblies are organised by Sixth Form students and include Christian, Hindu and Sikh, Humanist, Jewish, Muslim and Secular themes. A purpose-built Music House has 12 practice rooms and several classrooms, including one with space for orchestra rehearsals. A flood-lit, all-weather hockey pitch, tenniscourts, netball courts, rock climbing wall and swimming pool provide facilities for all-year-around sports.

        "prefix": "The swing era (also frequently referred to as the \"big band era\") was the period of time (1933\u20131947) when big band swing music",
        "reference": " was the most popular music in the United States. Though this was its most popular period, the music had actually been around since the late 1920s and early 1930s, being played by black bands led by such artists as Duke Ellington, Jimmie Lunceford, Bennie Moten, Cab Calloway, Earl Hines, and Fletcher Henderson, and white bands from the 1920s led by the likes of Jean Goldkette, Russ Morgan and Isham Jones. An early milestone in the era was from \u201cthe King of Swing\u201d Benny Goodman's performance at the Palomar Ballroom in Los Angeles on August 21, 1935, bringing the music to the rest of the country. The 1930s also became the era of other great soloists: the tenor saxophonists Coleman Hawkins, Ben Webster and Lester Young; the alto saxophonists Benny Carter and Johnny Hodges; the drummers Chick Webb, Gene Krupa, Jo Jones and Sid Catlett; the pianists Fats Waller and Teddy Wilson; the trumpeters Louis Armstrong, Roy Eldridge, Bunny Berigan, and Rex Stewart. Music experimentation has always been popular in America. Developments in dance orchestras and jazz music culminated in swing music during the early 1930s. It brought to fruition ideas originated with Louis Armstrong, Earl Hines, Fletcher Henderson, Duke Ellington, and Jean Goldkette. The swing era also was precipitated by spicing up familiar commercial, popular material with a Harlem oriented flavor and selling it via a white band for a white musical/commercial audience. In Benny Goodman\u2019s band, the most diversified styles flowed together: the ensemble style developed by Fletcher Henderson, who arranged for the band; the riff technique of Kansas City; and the precision and training of many white musicians. On the other hand, the easy melodic quality and clean intonation of Goodman\u2019s band made it possible to \u201csell\u201d jazz to a mass audience. The swing era brought to swing music Louis Armstrong, Billie Holiday, and by 1938 Ella Fitzgerald. Armstrong, who had heavily influenced jazz as its greatest soloist in the 1920s when working with both small bands and larger ones, now appeared only with big swing bands. Other musicians who rose during this time include Jimmy Dorsey, his brother Tommy Dorsey, Glenn Miller, Count Basie, Goodman's future rival Artie Shaw, and Woody Herman who departed the Isham Jones band in 1936 to start his own band. Several factors led to the demise of the swing era: the 1942\u201344 musicians' strike from August 1942 to November 1944 (The union that most jazz musicians belong to told its members not to record until the record companies agreed to pay them each time their music was played on the radio), the earlier ban of ASCAP songs from radio stations, World War II which made it harder for bands to travel around as well as the \"cabaret tax\", which was as high as 30%, the rise of vocalist-centered pop and the R&B as the dominant forms of popular music, and the rising interest in bebop among jazz musicians. Though some big bands survived through the late 1940s (Duke Ellington, Count Basie, Stan Kenton, Boyd Raeburn, Woody Herman), most of their competitors were forced to disband, bringing the swing era to a close. Big band jazz would experience a resurgence starting in the mid-1950s, but it would never attain the same popularity as it had during the swing era. During the 1920s the older two-beat style of jazz was superseded by four-beat jazz, facilitated by replacement of the sousaphone with the string bass. Four beat rhythm was the foundation of the Chicago style jazz developed by Louis Armstrong and Earl Hines, and of the swing era rhythmic styles. The change in rhythm started first with solo pianists and small ensembles, then larger ensembles towards the end of the decade. Toward the end of the twenties the two-beat styles seemed all but exhausted. First in Chicago, then in Harlem and Kansas City, a new way of playing developed around 1928-29. Chicago musicians migrating to Harlem brought their rhythmic ideas with them. As is so often the case in jazz, there are confusing exceptions to this general outline. Jimmie Lunceford\u2019s big band at the height of the Swing era employed a beat that was simultaneously 2/4 and 4/4. The Bob Crosby Orchestra and the Lionel Hampton Orchestra also featured two-beat rhythms long after four-beat rhythm became the standard. In May 1935, the No. 1 record in the country was Jimmie Lunceford\u2019s \u201cRhythm Is Our Business\u201d. Released a few months before Benny Goodman triggered the national craze known as swing, the song offered a foretaste of the coming deluge. \u201cRhythm is our business/ Rhythm is what we sell,\u201d Lunceford\u2019s singer declared: \u201cRhythm is our business / Business sure is swell\u201d. If rhythm defined the swing bands, its foundation lay in the rhythm section: piano, guitar, bass, and drums. In big bands, rhythm sections fused into a unified rhythmic front: supplying the beat and marking the harmonies. Each of the leading bands presented a distinct, well-designed rhythmic attack that complemented its particular style. The rhythm sections of Ellington, Basie, and Lunceford, for example, sounded nothing alike. Just as the soloists were champing at the bit of big-band constraints, rhythm players were developing techniques and ideas that demanded more attention than they usually received. In the 1930s, rhythm instruments made dramatic advances toward the foreground of jazz. In the process, they helped set the stage for bebop. In 1939, Duke Ellington discovered virtuoso young bassist Jimmie Blanton and hired him into his Orchestra. Blanton revolutionized the bass as a featured instrument in the band, until he tragically left the band in late 1941 due to terminal tuberculosis. Towards the end of the 1930s the roles of the piano, bass, and drums in the rhythm section changed significantly under the influence of the Count Basie Orchestra. Early swing drumming relied heavily on the bass and snare drums, with a secondary role for the high hat cymbal in timekeeping. Jo Jones inverted that relationship, making the high hat the primary timekeeper and using the bass and snare drums for accents and lead-ins. Basie introduced a rhythmically sparse style of piano playing emphasizing accents, lead-ins, and fills. Both of those changes increased the importance of the bass and guitar in timekeeping, ably held by Walter Page and Freddie Green. The lighter and sparser, yet more dynamic, sense of rhythm expressed by the Basie rhythm section lent greater freedom for the band's soloists and set a trend that would culminate in the rhythmic ideas of bebop. To help bands adjust to the new groove, major changes were made in the rhythm section. While the bass drum continued to play a rock-solid four beat pulse, the tuba, commonly used in large dance bands of the 1920s, was replaced by the string bass. During the early years of recording, the tuba was able to project a clear, huffing sound. But the string bass had been replacing the tuba over the rhythmic devices available with it and many players, including Wellman Braud with Duke Ellington\u2019s band, showed that the instrument had a special percussive flavor when the strings were given a pizzicato \u201cslap\u201d (plucked rather than bowed). Change came gradually in the late 1920s, once word had gotten around about how well the string bass worked; many tuba players realized that they\u2019d better switch instruments or lose their jobs. With Walter Page's bass replacing the tuba in Bennie Moten's Kansas City Orchestra, the way was laid clear for the band to develop the kinetic style of swing it would show under the leadership of Count Basie. The banjo, with its loud and raucous tone, was replaced with the guitar, which provided a more subtle and secure pulsation (chunk-chunk) in the foundation rhythm. As the saying went, the guitar was more felt than heard. Listeners felt the combined sound of bass, guitar, and drums as a sonic force that pushed through cavernous dance halls. \u201cIf you were on the first floor, and the dance hall was upstairs,\u201d Count Basie remembered, \u201cthat was what you would hear, that steady rump, rump, rump, rump in that medium tempo\u201d. As often noted by commentators on jazz history, the Swing era saw the saxophone supersede in many ways the trumpet as the dominant jazz solo instrument. Swing arrangements often emphasized the reed section to carry the melody, with trumpets providing accents and highlights. For this reason the types of solo improvisations would change dramatically during the thirties. Trumpeter Roy Eldridge deviated from the more common Armstrong-influenced styles towards a style of improvisation resembling that of reed players, and in turn would be an early influence on bebop trumpet pioneer Dizzy Gillespie. Coleman Hawkins and Benny Carter broke the barrier to early acceptance of the saxophone as a jazz instrument but it was the style of Frankie Trumbauer on C melody sax, showcased in the recordings he did with Bix Beiderbecke in 1927, that laid the groundwork for the style of saxophone playing that would make it a dominant influence on soloing styles. Lester Young, whose influence on saxophone playing became dominant towards the end of the 1930s, cited Trumbauer's linear, melodic approach to improvisation as his main inspiration for his own style. The Fletcher Henderson Orchestra in 1927 consisted of two trumpets, two trombones, three reeds, piano, banjo, tuba, and drums. The Goodman band in 1935 had three trumpets, two trombones, the leader\u2019s clarinet, two alto saxes, two tenor saxes, piano, guitar, bass, and drums, fourteen pieces in all, compared to Henderson\u2019s eleven in the earlier days. The piano-guitar-bass-drums rhythm section had become standard and kept a steady and uncluttered beat that was very easy to follow. Goodman was quite skilled at setting the perfect dance tempo for each song while alternating wild \u201ckiller dillers\u201d with slower ballads. In addition to Henderson and his younger brother Horace, Goodman employed top arrangers such as Fletcher Henderson, Jimmy Mundy, Deane Kincaide, Edgar Sampson, and Spud Murphy who put the melody first but included rhythmic figures in their charts and wrote arrangements that built to a logical climax. Mundy and Sampson had previously done arranging for Earl Hines and Chick Webb, respectively. In 1935, Goodman did not have many major soloists in his band. Unlike Duke Ellington, who went out of his way to hire unique individualists, and Count Basie, who came from a Kansas City tradition emphasizing soloists, Goodman was most concerned that his musicians read music perfectly, blended together naturally, and did not mind being subservient to the leader. It was the sound of the ensembles, the swinging rhythm section, and the leader\u2019s fluent clarinet that proved to be irresistible to his young and eager listeners. To fit the new groove, dance-band arranging became more inventive. To some extent, this was a belated influence of Louis Armstrong, whose rhythms continued to be absorbed by soloists and arrangers through the 1930s. Arrangers learned to write elaborate lines for an entire section, harmonized in block chords, called soli. They were conversant with chromatic (complex) harmony and knew how to make the most of their flexible orchestra. Arrangements could also arise spontaneously out of oral practice. But even in New York, where bands prided themselves on their musical literacy, musicians could take improvised riffs and harmonize them on the spot. The result, known as a head arrangement, was a flexible, unwritten arrangement created by the entire band. One musician compared it to child\u2019s play\u2014\u201ca lot of kids playing in the mud, having a big time\u201d. Both kinds of arrangements, written and unwritten, could be heard in the hundreds of recordings made in the 1930s by Fletcher Henderson. For flashy pieces, Henderson relied on experienced arrangers, from his brother Horace to Don Redman and Benny Carter. But his biggest hits emerged from the bandstand. One was \u201cSugar Foot Stomp,\u201d derived in the early 1920s from the King Oliver tune \u201cDippermouth Blues\u201d and still in the repertory. By the 1930s, it had evolved into a thoroughly up-to-date dance tune, with a faster tempo to match the tastes of the dancers. Another hit was \u201cKing Porter Stomp,\u201d a ragtime piece by Jelly Roll Morton that became radically simplified, shedding its two-beat clumsiness and march/ragtime form as it went. Many of these pieces were ultimately written down by Henderson, who became his band\u2019s chief arranger. His genius for rhythmic swing and melodic simplicity was so effective that his music became the standard for numerous swing arrangers. Henderson was fond of short, memorable riffs\u2014simple, bluesy phrases\u2014in call and response: saxophones responding to trumpets, for example. In some passages, he distorted the melody into ingenious new rhythmic shapes, often in staccato (detached) bursts that opened up space for the rhythm section. Henderson was shrewd and efficient. He wrote only a few choice choruses, leaving the remainder of the arrangement open for solos accompanied by discreet, long-held chords or short riffs. As each piece headed toward its climax, the band erupted in an ecstatic wail. The swing era produced many classic recordings. \"HEY! \"Where, I Wonder, Where\"? and \"What Would Happen To Me If Something Happened To You\"?\n",

        "reference": "med for the commodities they produce (like silk, honey, lac or insect tea), or for them themselves; to be used as food, as feed, as a dye, and otherwise. Silkworms, the caterpillars of the domestic silkmoth, are kept to produce silk, an elastic fiber made when they are in the process of creating a cocoon. Silk is commonly regarded as a major cash crop and is used in the crafting of many textiles. The mealworm (Tenebrio Molitor L.) is the larvae form of a species of darkling beetles (Coleoptera). The optimum incubation temperature is 25 \u030aC - 27 \u030aC and its embryonic development lasts 4 \u2013 6 days. It has a long larvae period of about half a year with the optimum temperature and low moisture terminates. The protein content of Tenebrio Molitor larvae, adult, exuvium and excreta are 46. 44, 63. 34, 32. 87, and 18. 51% respectively. Buffaloworms, also called lesser mealworms, is the common name of Alphitobius diaperinus. Its larvae superficially resemble small wireworms or true mealworms (Tenebrio spp. They are approximately 7 to 11\u00a0mm in length at last instar. Freshly-emerged larvae are a milky color. The pale color tinge returns to that of the first/second instar larva when preparing to molt, while a yellowish-brown appearance after molting. In addition, it was reported that it has the highest level of iron bioavilability. Commodities harvested from honeybees include beeswax, bee bread, bee pollen, propolis, royal jelly, brood, and honey. All of the aforementioned are mostly used in food, however, being wax, beeswax has many other uses, such as being used in candles, and propolis may be used as a wood finish. In recent years, wild populations of honeybees have declined significantly. Lac insects secrete a resinous substance called lac. Lac is used in many applications, from its use in food to being used as a colorant or as a wood finish. The majority of lac farming takes place in India and Thailand, with over 2 million residential employees. Made into a red dye known as carmine, cochineal are incorporated into lots of products, ranging cosmetics, food, paint, fabric, etc. About 100,000 insects are needed to make a single kilogram of dye. The shade of red the dye yields depends on how the insect is processed. France is the world\u2019s largest importer of carmine. Among the hundreds of different types of crickets, the house cricket (Acheta domesticus) is the most common type used for human consumption. The cricket is one of the most nutritious edible insects, and in many parts of the world, crickets are consumed dry-roasted, baked, deep-fried, and boiled. Cricket consumption may take the form of cricket flour, a powder of dried and ground crickets, which is easily integrated in to many food recipes. Crickets are commonly farmed for non-human animal food, as they provide much nutrition to the many species of reptiles, fish, birds and other mammals that consume them. Crickets are normally killed by deep freezing, where they feel no pain and are sedated before neurological death. Waxworms are the larvae of wax moths. These caterpillars are used widely across the world for food, fish bait, animal testing and plastic degradation. Low in protein but high in fat content, they are a valuable source of fat for many insectivorous organisms. Waxworms are popular in many parts of the world, due to their ability to live in low temperatures and their simplicity in production. Cockroaches are farmed by the million in China, and became an area of growth in the early 2000s. Insects are promising to be used as  animal feed. For instance, fly larvae can replace fish meal due to the similar amino acid composition. It is possible to formulate fish meal to increase unsaturated fatty acid. Wild birds and free-range poultry can consume insects inform an adult, larval and pupal naturally. Grasshoppers and moth, as well as the housefly, are reported as the feed supplements of poultry. Apart from that, insects have the potential as the feeds for reptile, soft monkey as well as birds. Insects are also farmed as food for human consumption (entomophagy). Entomophagy has lasted for as long as, as some sources suggest, 30,000 years. Insects are becoming increasingly viable as a source of protein in the modern diet, as conventional meat forms are very land-intensive and produce large quantities of methane, a greenhouse gas. Insects bred in captivity offer a low space-intensive, highly feed efficient, relatively pollution-free, high-protein source of food for both humans and non-human animals. Insects have a high nutritional value, dense protein content and micronutrient and probiotic potential. Insects such as crickets and mealworms have high concentrations of complete protein, vitamin B12, riboflavin and vitamin A. Insects offer an economical solution to increasingly pressing food security and environmental issues concerning the production and distribution of protein to feed a growing world population. Hundreds of species of crickets, grasshoppers, beetles, moths and various other insects are farmed for human consumption. Significantly less amounts resource and space use, less amounts of waste produced, and emissions of very trace amounts of greenhouse gases. They include many vitamins and essential minerals, contain dietary fiber (which is not present in meat), and are a complete protein. The protein count of 100g of cricket is nearly equivalent to the amount in 100g of lean ground beef. As opposed to meat, lower costs are required to care for and produce insects. Faster growth and reproduction rates. Crickets mature rather quickly and are typically full-grown within 3 weeks to a month, and an individual female can lay from 1,200 to 1,500 eggs in three to four weeks. Cattle, however, become adults at 2 years, and the breeding ratio is four breeding animals for each market animal produced. Unlike meat, insects rarely transmit diseases such as H1N1, mad cow disease, or salmonella. Cattle use 12 times the amount of feed that crickets do to produce an equal amount of protein. Crickets also only use a quarter of the feed of sheep and one half the amount of feed given to swine and chicken to produce an equivalent amount of protein. Crickets require only two pounds of feed to produce one pound of the finished product. Much of this efficiency is a result of crickets being ectothermic, as in they get their heat from the environment instead of having to expend energy to create their own body heat as typical mammals do. Insects are nutrient efficient compared to other meat sources. The insect protein content is comparable to most meat products. Likewise, the fatty acid composition of edible insects is comparable to fish lipids, with high levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids(PUFAs). The nutritional contents of insects vary with species as well as within species depending on their metamorphic stage, their habitat and their diet. For instance, the lipid composition of insects is largely dependent on their diet and metamorphic stage. Insect is abundant in other nutrients, Locusts for example contain between 8 and 20 milligrams of iron for every 100 grams of raw locust. Beef on the other hand contains roughly 6 milligrams of iron in the same amount of meat. Crickets as well are very efficient when you compare nutrients. For every 100 grams of substance crickets contain 12. 9 grams of protein, 121 calories, and 5. 5 grams of fat. Beef contains more protein containing 23. 5 grams in 100 grams of substance, but also has roughly 3 times the calories, and four times the amount of fat as crickets do in 100 grams. So, per 100 grams of substance, crickets contain only half the nutrients of beef, except for iron. High levels of iron are implicated in bowel cancer and heart disease. When considering the protein transition, cold-blood insects are enabling to convert food more efficiently. A fact about that is crickets only need 2. The raising of livestock is responsible for 18% of all greenhouse gases emitted. Alternative sources of protein, such as insects, replace protein sourced from livestock and help decrease the number of greenhouse gases emitted from food production. Insect raising has negligible emissions compared to livestock since no farmed insect species besides termites release methane, and none create ammonia. Livestock raising accounts for 70% of agricultural land use. This results in a tremendous amount of land-cover change which destroys local ecosystems and displaces people and wildlife. Insect farming is minimally space intensive compared to other conventional livestock, and can even take place in populated urban centers. With the concerning on animal health and welfare about the tolerance on pain, processing on the insects can be mainly concluded as: Harvesting and cleaning, Inactivation, heating and drying depending on the final product and rearing methods. Insects at different life stages can be collected by sieving followed by water cleaning when it is necessary to remove needless biomass or excretion. And before processing, the insects were sieved to stored alive at 4 \u2103 for about one day without any feed. An inactivation step was needed to inactive the enzyme and the microbial on the insects. The enzymatic browning reaction (mainly phenolase or phenol oxidase ) can cause the brown or black color on the insect, which leads to discoloration and the off-flavor. Sufficient heat treatment is required to kill Enterobacteriaceae so that the product can meet the safety requirement. D-value and Z-value can be used to estimate the effectiveness of heat treatments. The temperature and duration of the heating will cause insect proteins denaturation so that change the functional properties of proteins. To prevent spoilage, the products are dried up to lower the moisture content and prolong the shelf life. However, longer drying time results from a low evaporation rate due to the Chitin layer, which can prevent the insect from dehydration during their lifetime. So the product in granules form give the advantages of further drying. In general, insects have a moisture level in the range of 55-65%. A drying process decreasing the moisture content to a level of less than 10% is good for preservation. Besides the moisture level, oxidation of lipids can cause high levels of unsaturated fatty acids in products. Hence the processing steps influencing the final fat stability in products are necessary to be considered during drying. The use of insect meal as feed and food is limited by the legislation. Insects can be incorporate to the Novel Food according to the guidelines for market authorization of products of the European Union. Luckily, the Europe union commission accepts the use of insects for fish feed in July 2017. However, the power to promote the scale-up of insects production becomes difficult when only little participates in this market to change the rules. In Europe, documents of safety demonstration of certain insects and accompanying products are required by the European Union (EFSA) and NVWA.\n",

The band combine modern technology with archaic instrumentation over various media. The members have said they have dedicated their lives to art, to explore the nobleness of centuries in many possible ways (music, poetry, theatre, and photography). They define themselves as \"craftsmen of the sound\" because they create an unusual mix of sacred and profane, atmospheric and experimental, contemporary and early music, using acoustic and electric instruments as well, always with such language which fits best to the actual work. The word ataraxia is taken from Epicurean philosophy and means \"equanimity\", \"calmness\" and \"unflappability\". Ataraxia place themselves in a spiritual tradition from Greco-Roman and Celtic cultures. Nicoli has described the production process as \"medianic\" and associated it with the cult of Dionysus, where \"the musician was possessed by the God of Nature who spoke through him/her\". Regarding the band's pagan themes, Nicoli associates the word paganism with the countryside, and maintains that life in the countryside creates a connection to the rhythm of nature.

In 2005, it was listed on UNESCO's Memory of the World Register. The Biblioteca Palafoxiana owes its name and foundation to Juan de Palafox y Mendoza, bishop of Puebla. On 6 September 1646, Palafox y Mendoza donated 5,000 of his own items to the Colegio de San Juan\u2014which was founded by him\u2014on the condition that they be made available to the general public. He wrote that \"it is very useful and convenient that there should be in this city and kingdom a public library, where all sorts of people will be able to study as they wish\". More than a century later, Francisco Fabi\u00e1n y Fuero ordered the construction of the premises which currently house the Biblioteca Palafoxiana. He donated his own collection, and the collections of the bishops Manuel Fern\u00e1ndez de Santa Cruz and Francisco Pablo V\u00e1zquez and the dean of the Francisco Irigoyen Cathedral were gradually added, as were volumes from Pueblan religious schools and individuals. Books confiscated from Jesuits upon their expulsion in 1767 were also added. The library was finished in 1773, consisting of a 43-meter-long vaulted hall on the Colegio's second floor. Two levels of bookshelves were built, and a retablo of the Madonna of Trapani by Nino Pisano was acquired. By the mid-19th century, the size of the collection necessitated a third level of bookshelves. Two earthquakes in 1999 caused damage to the building and shelves, leading to a restoration program in 2001. The library is open Tuesday through Friday 10am-6pm and Saturday and Sunday from 10am to 6pm. The library has, since its inception, been used by any person who wishes to study. Today, it houses the Institute for Bibliographical Research which has been in charge of publishing \"Los Impresos de la Biblioteca Palafoxiana\" promoting the historical value of the collections and its museum. The Biblioteca Palafoxiana has more than 41,000 books and manuscripts, ranging from the 15th to the 20th century. It has three major collections: old books, manuscripts, and pamphlets and broadsheets. It also has nine incunabula. The oldest text in the library is the Nuremberg Chronicle dated 1493.\n",

The central campus lies within the Be\u015fikta\u015f district. The new  lies within the Esenler district. The university has 10 faculty, 3 vocational schools, and 2 institutions. Y\u0131ld\u0131z Technical University has a distinguished history that dates to 1911. YTU was founded as Kond\u00fckt\u00f6r Mekteb-i \u00c2lisi (Conductors School of Higher Education) in order to meet the \"science officer\" (known previously as conductors, and today as technicians) needs of the Municipality Public Works Section. The school was modeled on the syllabus of the \"Ecole de Conducteur\" and was affiliated with the Ministry of Public Works. The school's name was changed to Nafia Fen Mektebi (School of Public Works) in 1922. The duration of education was increased to two and a half years in 1926 and three years in 1931. Following the increase in public facilities and the requirement for technical services, a ruling ordered the closure of Nafia Fen Mektebi and the establishment of a Technical School to supply the workforce for the gap between technical officers and professional engineers. The school provided a two-year program for technical officers and a four-year program for engineers. Buildings were granted from the Y\u0131ld\u0131z Palace annexes, which are still in use today. In the early period, the school consisted of civil and mechanical departments, educating students as technical officers and engineers. Starting with the 1942-1943 semester, electrical and architecture departments were added as part of the Department of Engineering. The school was established as an autonomous higher education and research institution in 1969. With a law which ruled for the closing of special vocational schools in 1971, engineering schools were affiliated with the Istanbul State Engineering and Architectural Academy. Y\u0131ld\u0131z University was formed by the merger of the Istanbul State Engineering and Architectural Academy along with affiliated schools of engineering, and related faculties and departments of the Kocaeli State Engineering and Architecture Academy together with the Kocaeli Vocational School. The new university incorporated a Science Institute, a Social Sciences Institute, and the departments of Science-Literature and Engineering, Foreign Languages, Turkish Language, Atat\u00fcrk Principles & the History of Revolution, Physical Education and Fine Arts. The university took its final name in 1992 as Y\u0131ld\u0131z Technical University. The Faculty of Engineering was divided into four faculties and restructured as: Faculty of Electrical-Electronics, Faculty of Construction, Faculty of Mechanical and Chemical-Metallurgy, and Faculty of Economics and Administrative Sciences. The Kocaeli Faculty of Engineering and the Kocaeli Vocational School were separated from the university to be restructured as Kocaeli University.

The bill is pointed and black with some blue-gray at the base of the lower mandible (Howell and Webb 1995). The adult male of the nominate subspecies has chestnut on the underparts, shoulder, and rump, with the rest of the plumage black. In the subspecies I. s. fuertesi, the chestnut is replaced with ochre (Howell and Webb 1995). The adult female and the juvenile of both subspecies have olive-green on the upper parts and yellowish on the breast and belly. All adults have pointed bills and white wing bars. (Orchard orioles are considered to be adults after their second year. ) One-year-old males are yellow-greenish with a black bib. The breeding habitat is semi-open areas with deciduous trees. I. s. spurius breeds in spring across eastern North America from near the Canada\u2013United States border south to central Mexico. A 2009 study also found breeding in the thorn forest of Baja California Sur and the coast of Sinaloa during the summer \"monsoon\"; this region had previously been thought to be only a migratory stopover (Rohwer, Hobson, and Rohwer, 2009). I. s. fuertesi breeds from southern Tamaulipas to Veracruz (Howell and Webb 1995). These birds enjoy living in shaded trees within parks along lakes and streams. The nest is a tightly woven pouch attached to a fork on a horizontal branch. Their nests tend to sit close together. The nominate subspecies' winter range extends from the coastal lowlands of central Sinaloa and southern Veracruz south to northern Colombia and northwestern Venezuela (Scharf and Kren 1996). The ochre subspecies has been observed in winter on the Pacific slope of Mexico (Howell and Webb 1995). Nominate orchard orioles depart from their winter habitats in March and April and arrive in their breeding habitats from late April to late May. Usually, they leave their breeding territories in late July and early August and arrive on their winter territories in mid August. These birds are nocturnal migrants. While in breeding season, they eat insects and spiders. When the season changes, their diet also includes ripe fruit, which quickly passes through their digestive tract. During the winter, their diet consists of fruit, nectar, insects and seeds. During courtship, females display themselves in three ways. The first is by bowing their head and torso toward the male. Seesawing, the second courtship display, involves repetitively alternating lowering and raising the head and tail. The third display is begging, which is fast-paced fluttering of wings halfway extended, followed by a high whistle. The specific name spurius refers to the original misidentification of the male as a female Baltimore oriole. These birds are sometimes mistakenly identified as New World warblers.\n",

        "reference": "way and Holstein-Gottorp in Traventhal. Denmark had to return Holstein-Gottorp to its duke, a Swedish ally, and to leave the anti-Swedish alliance. The Danes only reentered the war after Sweden's major defeat in the Battle of Poltava, 1709 having used the time to reform their army. The treaty was guaranteed by France, the Holy Roman Empire, the United Provinces (Netherlands) and Great Britain. In 1698 and 1699, Peter the Great of Russia, Augustus II the Strong of Saxony and Poland\u2013Lithuania, as well as Christian V and his successor Frederick IV of Denmark-Norway agreed on a three-front assault on the Swedish Empire, where minor Charles XII had ascended the throne in 1697. Holstein-Gottorp, just south of Denmark, was tied to Sweden by the marriage of duke Frederick IV to Hedvig Sophia, daughter of Charles XI of Sweden, in 1698. Danish forces entered Holstein-Gottorp in March 1700 and besieged the fortress of T\u00f6nning, while August the Strong was advancing through Swedish Livonia. In the meantime, Sweden had negotiated the support of the Maritime Powers, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, against Danish assaults on Holstein-Gottorp. Such assaults violated the Altona convention of 1689, of which the Maritime Powers were the guarantors. In addition, the Maritime Powers prepared for the emerging War of the Spanish Succession and therefore opposed an additional war in the Baltic Sea. Aided by the Dutch and British navies, a Swedish fleet deployed a 10,000 strong army near Copenhagen. Caught by surprise and unable to defend his capital, Frederik IV of Denmark-Norway had to make peace. As soon as the end of the war was in sight, the Maritime Powers withdrew their vessels and made it clear that they preferred a peace at once and had no interest in Sweden crushing and annexing Denmark. In Travendal, Denmark left the Great Northern War by obliging herself to not engage in future armed conflicts with Sweden. In paragraph XIII, the king of Denmark and Norway in his own name and the name of his successors promises to neither engage in hostilities with Sweden nor ally with or in any way aid Sweden's enemies, and adhere to all earlier Dano-Swedish treaties. The duke of Holstein-Gottorp's sovereignty was restored, and the treaty detailed the conditions under which armies and fortresses were to be maintained in the area. It was further agreed that Holstein-Gottorp be financially compensated by Denmark for the war costs, resulting in the subsequent payment of 260,000 Reichstalers. Paragraph XIV mentions France, the Holy Roman Emperor, the dukes of the Holy Roman Empire, and the guarantors of the Altona convention as guarantors of the treaty. The guarantees of the United Provinces and the United Kingdom for the treaty were reconfirmed in a convention signed by the aforementioned parties after Queen Anne's succession in Great Britain, 1702. By the time of Travendal, Augustus II the Strong's campaign in Swedish Livonia had not produced satisfactory results. Though D\u00fcnam\u00fcnde was captured and renamed \"Augustusburg\", he failed to take Riga or gain the support of the local nobility. Furthermore, Russia's forces had not yet entered the Great Northern War, as they were bound by the Russo-Turkish War until the Peace of Constantinople set them free in the summer. Thus, August's reaction to Travendal was to enter negotiations with France and Brandenburg-Prussia and ask them to mediate a truce with Sweden. Charles XII of Sweden, however, rejected the offer, refusing to enter negotiations as long as Saxon forces were in Livonia. Peter the Great took a more indifferent stance, and marched his troops towards Swedish Ingria as agreed on in the Treaty of Preobrazhenskoye. As soon as Denmark was out of the war, Charles XII speedily embarked his armies and headed from Denmark to his Baltic dominions. Russian forces entered Ingria and laid siege to Narva in October, while August the Strong was preparing winter quarters in Livonia. On 30 November, Charles XII's army relieved Narva before turning south sweeping August the Strong's forces out of Livonia, pursuing and decisively defeating them at Kliszow and Fraustadt during the following years, forcing August to drop out of the war in the Treaty of Altranst\u00e4dt in 1706. The tide turned only in 1709, when Charles XII's last remaining adversary Peter the Great was able to crush his army at Poltava and exile the Swedish king to Bender in the Ottoman Empire. Denmark and Saxony then abandoned Travendal and Altranst\u00e4dt and entered the war again. Frederik IV of Denmark used the peace period to reform the Danish army. Instead of relying on mercenaries, the army was now raised from peasants distributed by Danish landowners. The mercenary force was kept and fought on the Maritime Powers' side in the War of the Spanish Succession against roi soleil Louis XIV of France. Frederik also implemented civil reforms such as the abolishment of serfdom. When he re-entered the Great Northern War, the mercenaries were still fighting France, but were returned to participate in the war in 1713.\n",

        "reference": " Birmingham City and the Turkish national team. His father is a Turkish Cypriot who came to England as a small boy, and his mother is English. His younger brother, Kemal, also became a professional footballer. Izzet signed as a schoolboy for Chelsea, but never made a first team appearance during three years at the London club. He moved to Leicester City in March 1996 on loan for the rest of the season. He became a regular in the side, scoring one goal. When Leicester beat Crystal Palace in the play-offs, Izzet was able to make his move permanent for a fee of \u00a3800,000. He kept his place in the side for their Premier League season, which was successful for City. They came 9th in the Premier League, and won the League Cup. Izzet formed a partnership in midfield with Neil Lennon, which proved vital for Leicester. In the 1998\u201399 season, Leicester came 10th in league, and reaching the League Cup final again, but lost out to Tottenham Hotspur. The following season, Leicester came 8th, and again got to the League Cup Final, this time coming up against Tranmere Rovers, of Division One. This year they won 2\u20131, with Matt Elliott getting both goals. Izzet had been a regular in the side through all of this time. After Martin O'Neill left, Izzet remained a Leicester player. His time at Leicester drew interest from West Ham and Middlesbrough, but he did not leave the club. The following season started with a 5\u20130 home defeat to newly promoted Bolton Wanderers. Despite pledging to stay at Leicester during pre-season, Izzet handed in a transfer request in autumn of 2001, prior to the club's relegation, but he rejected a move to Middlesbrough as he did not want to be seen to be \"jumping ship\". He did issue a plea to O'Neill, who was now manager of Scottish Premier League side Celtic, to sign him in May 2002, remarking that \"only an idiot wouldn't consider joining Celtic\". Following their relegation at the end of the 2001\u201302 season, Izzet was again strongly touted for a move to Boro. However, Leicester insisted they would not accept a reduced offer from Middlesbrough for Izzet, who was priced at \u00a36 million, and no deal came to fruition. He withdrew his transfer request in March 2003, after the club achieved automatic promotion by finishing in second place. In January 2004, Leicester rejected \u00a3500,000 bids from Aston Villa and Blackburn Rovers for Izzet. At the end of the 2003\u201304 season, Leicester were again relegated. Unable to afford Izzet's \u00a330,000 per week wages, the club admitted he was leaving. Izzet joined Birmingham City in June 2004 on a free transfer, signing a three-year deal. Injury plagued his first season, with him making only a handful of appearances, though he did score his first league goal for Birmingham, an equaliser against Bolton Wanderers. His second season was worse, with a knee injury keeping him out for a long period of time. Izzet announced his retirement from football on 27 June 2006. On 28 November 2009, Izzet made a shock last minute return to Saturday football with Leicestershire Senior League side Thurmaston Town. However, he admitted days later that his knee was still very sore and was quoted saying \"whether I can turn out for Thurmaston every week is another thing\". He never played for them again. Izzet now runs a football academy with fellow former professional footballer and former Leicester teammate Steve Walsh. In September 2015 Izzet's autobiography was published, titled \"Muzzy: My Story\". The autobiography was co-written with Leicester Mercury writer Lee Marlow. Izzet is an ambassador for Dorothy Goodman School, a Special Educational Needs school in Hinckley, Leicestershire.\n",

        "reference": "uc\u00eda, to the southwest of Marbella, Spain on the Costa del Sol. It was built in May 1970 by Jos\u00e9 Ban\u00fas, a local property developer, as a luxury marina and shopping complex. It has since become one of the largest entertainment centres in the Costa del Sol, with 5 million annual visitors, and is popular with international celebrities. Developed around a coastal village in the Mediterranean architectural style, Puerto Ban\u00fas contains expensive shopping malls, restaurants and bars around the marina. The architect Noldi Schreck, who participated in the design and construction of Beverly Hills, was visited in 1966 by Prince Alfonso de Hohenlohe to ask him to work on the Hotel Marbella Club. Schreck's first job was to meet Jos\u00e9 Ban\u00fas (a close friend of Francisco Franco), and convince him that Puerto Ban\u00fas was not a suitable place to build huge skyscrapers that would house thousands of wealthy families. He proposed a sophisticated Andalusian village and marina, the first port made by a single architect. Jos\u00e9 Ban\u00fas became the largest developer of residential tourism complexes on the Costa del Sol. The port took his name and he became famous with the epithet \"the regime\u2019s builder\". The lavish opening of the complex in May 1970 was attended by, amongst others, the Aga Khan, film director Roman Polanski, Playboy founder Hugh Hefner, Dr. Christiaan Barnard (pioneer of the heart transplant), and Prince Rainier and Princess Grace of Monaco. A young Julio Iglesias was hired to sing for the guests for the sum of 125,000 pesetas. Three hundred waiters from Seville served 22 kilos of beluga caviar to 1700 guests. In 2011, it was reported that one of the largest-scale developments in Marbella's history was to take place with a 400 million euro investment into La Bajadilla, east of Marbella, by Qatari Sheikh Abdullah Ben Nasser Al-Thani which included a  quay for cruise liners, a five-star hotel on the marina, as well as bars, restaurants, shops and supermarkets to compete with Puerto Ban\u00fas. Puerto Ban\u00fas is located on the Costa del Sol of southeast Spain,  southwest of Marbella,  southwest of M\u00e1laga and  south of Madrid. The climate of the area is protected in its northern part by the Coast Mountain Range of Cordillera Penib\u00e9tica. It has a microclimate that produces a mean annual temperature of. The M\u00e1laga Airport is  away. There is a good network of roads and transport services connecting Puerto Ban\u00fas with adjacent towns and suburbs. According to the Municipality of Marbella, Puerto Ban\u00fas is visited annually by nearly 5 million people. Visitors to the port tend to be mostly tourists from northern Europe (especially United Kingdom) and Arabs (especially Kuwait and Saudi Arabia), along with Spanish tourists. The focal point of Puerto Ban\u00fas is the marina. It has berths for 915 boats, including those of the King of Saudi Arabia and several of the world's wealthiest individuals. Behind the harbour lie streets filled with bars, boutiques and nightclubs. The marina has slips for boats and ships from. Its surface area is, and its depth ranges from  within the marina, with  at its entrance. There is a beach on each side of the marina where boats can be hired. From M\u00e1laga airport, transport options include car rental, taxi, or bus. The main road A-7 also known as the Autovia del Mediterraneo on its way to Puerto Banus has the toll road or the non toll road which has views from the Costa. Its streets are lined with expensive luxury boutiques like Christian Dior, Gucci, Bvlgari, Versace, Dolce & Gabbana, Elisabetta Franchi and others. One stretch is known as \"The Golden Mile\". Apart from the chain of restaurants, boutiques, in the heart of the Antonio Banderas Square is one of the largest El Corte Ingles department stores in Spain, including the up-scale hypermarket, Hipercor. The Boulevard de la Fama de Puerto Ban\u00fas was created to pay tribute to individuals who have promoted Marbella nationally or internationally through their professional work. A three-ton statue of a rhinoceros by Salvador Dal\u00ed was placed in Puerto Ban\u00fas in 2004. Officially known as Rinoceronte vestido con puntillas (\"Rhinoceros dressed in lace\"), Dal\u00ed created the sculpture in 1956 following the filming of his surrealist movie La aventura prodigiosa de la encajera y el rinoceronte (\"The prodigious adventure of the lacemaker and the rhinoceros\") in 1954. Another impressive statue sculpted in bronze and copper by the Georgian sculptor Zurab Tsereteli is that of \"La Victoria\", which stands tall at  height over a granite pedestal. Unveiled in 1994, it was a gift from the Mayor of Moscow.\n",

        "reference": " serves is partly in the City of Westminster and partly in the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea. A mission was started in Bayswater in 1849. As the labourers building Paddington Station were mainly Irish Catholic, Cardinal Wiseman, saw a need for a Catholic church in the area, and asked Provost Henry Manning to undertake the task. The construction of the original building began in 1851 to original designs by Thomas Meyer in the Puginian Gothic style. Meyers also built, around the same time, St. Joseph's Church in Avon Dassett. Work was temporarily interrupted due to lack of funds, but was completed in 1857 by Manning's kinsman Henry Clutton, with additions by John Francis Bentley. Meyer also designed an earlier school chapel, also on Moorhouse Road. The church was initially dedicated to St Helen, in honour of Mrs Helen Hargrave, a benefactress. A stained glass window in the north aisle depicting St Vincent de Paul, the Madonna and St John the Evangelist was done by James      Powell & Sons based on a sketch by John Hungerford Pollen for the Chapel of Studley Royal, adapted as a memorial to Pollen. It was listed as Grade II* by English Heritage in 1970. The Congregation of Oblates of St. Charles were founded by Cardinal Wiseman. The religious orders established in his diocese did not seem to him to answer adequately to modern conditions, nor were they wholly at his disposal. The priests of the Oratory, gathered round Faber and Newman, showed him, however, what may be looked for from a diocesan society. Manning was at that time at the Cardinal's disposal, and it was to him that the duty was entrusted of founding the new society, and of drawing up its rules. Manning took the Oblates of Milan as his pattern, and gave his priests the title of \"Oblates of St. Charles\". The rules which he prescribed for them were practically those drawn up by St. Charles Borromeo for his disciples adapted to English conditions, and were approved by the Holy See in 1857 and in 1877. Wiseman installed his Oblates, with their superior and founder, at the church of St. Mary of the Angels, Bayswater, on Whit Monday 1877. Before long they had created other missions or religious centres in the diocese of Westminster. Nor did the opposition of Errington, Wiseman's coadjutor, and of the Westminster chapter, hinder the advance of the society, though the Cardinal found himself, under the necessity of withdrawing them from his seminary at St. Edmund's, where he had placed them. Under Manning's direction, the Oblates devoted themselves to various apostolic labours in London, and established several parishes in the two dioceses of Westminster and Southwark. Manning governed the Bayswater community from 1857 to 1868. He held that the mission of the Oblates was to revive the English secular clergy by taking part in its life and in its labours, and thus setting them an example. In 1882, the Oblates opened Our Lady of the Holy Souls Church on Bosworth Road in Kensal New Town. Ronald Knox preached a sermon on St. Charles Borromeo at St. Mary's. The Oblates continued their ministry at St. Mary's until the mid-1970s.\n",

        "reference": " of planning and governance in San Francisco, San Jose and Oakland. SPUR's history dates back to 1910, when a group of young city leaders came together to improve the quality of housing after the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and fire. That group, the San Francisco Housing Association, authored a hard-hitting report which led to the State Tenement House Act of 1911. In the 1930s, SFHA continued to advocate for housing concerns. In the 1940s, SFHA merged with Telesis, a group of graduates from UC Berkeley's city planning program, to become the San Francisco Planning and Housing Association. In 1942, the association landed a major success with the creation of San Francisco's Department of City Planning. During the 1950s, SFPHA pushed for the revitalization of San Francisco as the Bay Area's central city, in an effort to curb suburban sprawl and channel growth back into the urban core. In 1959, the San Francisco Planning and Housing Association was reorganized into the San Francisco Planning and Urban Renewal Association and, in 1977, the San Francisco Planning and Urban Research Association. The group has helped shape some of the most important planning decisions in the region, from the founding of the Bay Area Rapid Transit system (BART) to the preservation of the Golden Gate National Recreation Area. Retaining growth in the urban core was evaluated in cultural and racial terms. As late as 1966, SPUR's rationale for revitalization was the aspiration San Francisco's \"population will move closer to'standard White Anglo-Saxon Protestant\u2019 characteristics\". Over the years, the organization has grown to more than 6,000 members and has diversified its focus, analyzing subjects from sea-level rise and renewable energy to bicycle lanes and the ties between the Beat movement and the cultural understanding of urbanism. SPUR also provides annual analysis and selective endorsement of San Francisco ballot measures. In June 2009, SPUR moved into new headquarters at 654 Mission Street. This location houses the majority of SPUR's staff, as well as a gallery, a research library, and meeting space for SPUR's regular hosted talks. In  2012, SPUR initiated a long-range plan to work in all three of the Bay Area's central cities.

        "prefix": "Parsley or garden parsley (Petroselinum crispum) is a species of flowering plant in the family Apiaceae that is native to",
        "reference": " the central and eastern Mediterranean region (Lebanon, Israel, Cyprus, southern Italy, Greece, Portugal, Spain, Malta, Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia), but has naturalized elsewhere in Europe, and is widely cultivated as a herb, and a vegetable. Where it grows as a biennial, in the first year, it forms a rosette of tripinnate leaves,  long, with numerous  leaflets and a taproot used as a food store over the winter. In the second year, it grows a flowering stem with sparser leaves and umbels with yellow to yellowish-green flowers. Parsley is widely used in European, Middle Eastern, and American cuisine. Curly leaf parsley is often used as a garnish. In central Europe, eastern Europe, and southern Europe, as well as in western Asia, many dishes are served with fresh green chopped parsley sprinkled on top. Flat leaf parsley is similar, but it is easier to cultivate, and some say it has a stronger flavor. Root parsley is very common in central, eastern, and southern European cuisines, where it is used as a snack or a vegetable in many soups, stews, and casseroles. The word \"parsley\" is a merger of Old English petersilie (which is identical to the contemporary German word for parsley: Petersilie) and the Old French peresil, both derived from Medieval Latin petrosilium, from Latin petroselinum, which is the latinization of the Greek \u03c0\u03b5\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03c3\u03ad\u03bb\u03b9\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd (petroselinon), \"rock-celery\", from \u03c0\u03ad\u03c4\u03c1\u03b1 (petra), \"rock, stone\", + \u03c3\u03ad\u03bb\u03b9\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd (selinon), \"celery\". <ref>\u03c3\u03ad\u03bb\u03b9\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexi</ref>Interactive Flora of NW Europe: Petroselinum crispum Mycenaean Greek se-ri-no, in Linear B, is the earliest attested form of the word selinon. Garden parsley is a bright green, biennial plant in temperate climates, or an annual herb in subtropical and tropical areas. Where it grows as a biennial, in the first year, it forms a rosette of tripinnate leaves 10\u201325\u00a0cm long with numerous 1\u20133\u00a0cm leaflets, and a taproot used as a food store over the winter. In the second year, it grows a flowering stem to  tall with sparser leaves and flat-topped 3\u201310\u00a0cm diameter umbels with numerous 2\u00a0mm diameter yellow to yellowish-green flowers. The seeds are ovoid, 2\u20133\u00a0mm long, with prominent style remnants at the apex. One of the compounds of the essential oil is apiol. The plant normally dies after seed maturation. Blamey, M. & Grey-Wilson, C. (1989). Illustrated Flora of Britain and Northern Europe. Parsley is a source of flavonoids and antioxidants, especially luteolin, apigenin, folic acid, vitamin K, vitamin C, and vitamin A. Half a tablespoon (a gram) of dried parsley contains about 6. 0\u00a0\u00b5g of lycopene and 10. 7\u00a0\u00b5g of alpha carotene as well as 82. 9\u00a0\u00b5g of lutein+zeaxanthin and 80. 7\u00a0\u00b5g of beta carotene. Excessive consumption of parsley should be avoided by pregnant women. Normal food quantities are safe for pregnant women, but consuming excessively large amounts may have uterotonic effects. Parsley grows best in moist, well-drained soil, with full sun. It grows best between, and usually is grown from seed. Germination is slow, taking four to six weeks, and it often is difficult because of furanocoumarins in its seed coat. Typically, plants grown for the leaf crop are spaced 10\u00a0cm apart, while those grown as a root crop are spaced 20\u00a0cm apart to allow for the root development. Parsley attracts several species of wildlife. Some swallowtail butterflies use parsley as a host plant for their larvae; their caterpillars are black and green striped with yellow dots, and will feed on parsley for two weeks before turning into butterflies. Bees and other nectar-feeding insects also visit the flowers. Birds such as the goldfinch feed on the seeds. In cultivation, parsley is subdivided into several cultivar groups, depending on the form of the plant, which is related to its end use. Often these are treated as botanical varieties, but they are cultivated selections, not of natural botanical origin. The two main groups of parsley used as herbs are French, or curly leaf (P. crispum crispum group; syn. P. crispum var. crispum); and, Italian, or flat leaf (P. crispum neapolitanum group; syn. P. crispum var. neapolitanum). Of these, the neapolitanum group more closely resembles the natural wild species. Flat-leaved parsley is preferred by some gardeners as it is easier to cultivate, being more tolerant of both rain and sunshine, and is said to have a stronger flavor \u2014 although this is disputed \u2014 while curly leaf parsley is preferred by others because of its more decorative appearance in garnishing. Growing Herbs: How to Grow Parsley  A third type, sometimes grown in southern Italy, has thick leaf stems resembling celery. Another type of parsley is grown as a root vegetable, the Hamburg root parsley (P. crispum radicosum group, syn. P. crispum var. tuberosum). This type of parsley produces much thicker roots than types cultivated for their leaves. Although seldom used in Britain and the United States, root parsley is common in central and eastern European cuisine, where it is used in soups and stews, or simply eaten raw, as a snack (similar to carrots). Although root parsley looks similar to the parsnip, which is among its closest relatives in the family Apiaceae, its taste is quite different. Parsley is widely used in Middle Eastern, Mediterranean, Brazilian, and American cuisine. Curly leaf parsley is used often as a garnish. Green parsley is used frequently as a garnish on potato dishes (boiled or mashed potatoes), on rice dishes (risotto or pilaf), on fish, fried chicken, lamb, goose, and steaks, as well in meat or vegetable stews (including shrimp creole, beef bourguignon, goulash, or chicken paprikash). In central Europe, eastern Europe, and southern Europe, as well as in western Asia, many dishes are served with fresh green, chopped parsley sprinkled on top. In southern and central Europe, parsley is part of bouquet garni, a bundle of fresh herbs used as an ingredient in stocks, soups, and sauces. Freshly chopped green parsley is used as a topping for soups such as chicken soup, green salads, or salads such as salade Olivier, and on open sandwiches with cold cuts or p\u00e2t\u00e9s. Persillade is a mixture of chopped garlic and chopped parsley in French cuisine. Parsley is the main ingredient in Italian salsa verde, which is a mixed condiment of parsley, capers, anchovies, garlic, and sometimes bread, soaked in vinegar. It is an Italian custom to serve it with bollito misto or fish. Gremolata, a mixture of parsley, garlic, and lemon zest, is a traditional accompaniment to the Italian veal stew, ossobuco alla milanese. In England, parsley sauce is a roux-based sauce, commonly served over fish or gammon. Root parsley is very common in Central, Eastern, and Southern European cuisines, where it is used as a snack or a vegetable in many soups, stews, and casseroles, and as ingredient for broth. In Brazil, freshly chopped parsley () and freshly chopped scallion () are the main ingredients in the herb seasoning called  (literally \"green aroma\"), which is used as key seasoning for major Brazilian dishes, including meat, chicken, fish, rice, beans, stews, soups, vegetables, salads, condiments, sauces, and stocks. is sold in food markets as a bundle of both types of fresh herbs. In some Brazilian regions, chopped parsley may be replaced by chopped coriander (also called cilantro,  in Portuguese) in the mixture. Parsley is a key ingredient in several Middle Eastern salads such as Lebanese tabbouleh; it is also often mixed in with the chickpeas and/or fava beans while making falafel (that gives the inside of the falafel its green color). It is also a main component of the Iranian stew ghormeh sabzi.\n",

A sequel was released in 2003. During development, the game was originally called WWF Raw is War, but the title was changed after the WWF shortened the TV show's title in October 2001 due to September 11 attacks and end of Monday Night Wars. In Japan, a limited edition was released with a shirt and a figure of the Undertaker or Hollywood Hulk Hogan (who does not appear in the game). The game offers the players a wrestling experience with various matches like singles match, tag team match, triple threat, fatal four-way, battle royal and handicap matches. The players can also play various tournaments such as King of the Ring and several title tournaments. They can create their own character as well as their attire, move set and entrance. The game has a weak/strong grapple system and there are two types of grapples: one which is done with normal opponents and other with groggy opponents. The normal grapples do little harm when compared to grapples done when the opponent is stunned. There is a voltage meter which shows the momentum of the wrestlers. Special move, high flying attacks and taunting boost the momentum while repeated attacks cost loss in momentum. Finishers can only be applied when the opponent is stunned and the voltage meter is flashing. Excessive use of finisher also cause loss in momentum. The game received \"mixed or average reviews\" on both platforms according to video game review aggregator Metacritic. In Japan, Famitsu gave the Xbox version an unfavorably low score of 10 out of 40.\n",

        "prefix": "The Female Man is a feminist science fiction novel by American writer Joanna Russ. It was originally written in 1970 and first published in 1975 by Bantam Books.",
        "reference": " Russ was an avid feminist and challenged sexist views during the 1970s with her novels, short stories, and nonfiction works. These works include We Who Are About To., \"When It Changed\", and What Are We Fighting For? : Sex, Race, Class, and the Future of Feminism. The novel follows the lives of four women living in parallel worlds that differ in time and place. When they cross over to each other's worlds, their different views on gender roles startle each other's preexisting notions of womanhood. In the end, their encounters influence them to evaluate their lives and shape their ideas of what it means to be a woman. The character Joanna calls herself the \u201cfemale man\u201d because she believes that she must forget her identity as a woman in order to be respected (p. 5). She states that \u201cthere is one and only one way to possess that in which we are defective\u00a0. Become it\u201d (p. 139). Her metaphorical transformation refers to her decision to seek equality by rejecting women's dependence on men. Jonathan Swift refers to Queen Anne as a \"female man\" in Chapter 4 of the Houyhnhnms section of Gulliver's Travels. The Female Man includes several fictional worlds. Joanna's World: Joanna exists in a world that is similar to Earth in the 1970s. Jeannine's World: Jeannine lives in a world where the Great Depression never ended. The Second World War never happened because Adolf Hitler was assassinated in 1936, and Chiang Kai-shek controls Hong Kong, as Japanese imperialism still dominates the Chinese mainland. Janet's World (Whileaway): Janet lives in a world called Whileaway, a utopian society in the far future where all the men died from a gender-specific plague over 800 years ago. In the final chapter, Jael suggests that the men were actually killed. To procreate, women in lesbian relationships use technology to genetically merge ova, also called parthenogenesis. Although the world is technologically advanced, their societies are mostly agrarian. Joanna Russ's Nebula Award winning short story When It Changed (1972) also takes place on Whileaway, but earlier. Jael's World: Jael's world is a dystopia where men and women are literally engaged in a \"battle of the sexes\". Although they have been in conflict for over 40 years, the two societies still participate in trade with each other. Women trade children in exchange for resources. In order for men to cope with their sexual desires, young boys undergo cosmetic surgery that physically changes their appearance so that they look like women. Jael is heterosexual and has sex with Davy, a genetically modified ape, designed as an attractive and sexually submissive young man, at her home. The novel begins when Janet Evason suddenly arrives in Joanna's world. Janet is from Whileaway, a futuristic world where a plague killed all of the men over 800 years ago, and Jeannine lives in a world that never experienced the end of the Great Depression. Janet finds Jeannine at a Chinese New Year festival and takes her to Joanna's world. Joanna comes from a world that is beginning its feminist movement. Acting as a guide, Joanna takes Janet to a party in her world to show her how women and men interact with each other. Janet quickly finds herself the object of a man's attention, and after he harasses her, Janet knocks the man down and mocks him. Because Joanna's world believes that women are inferior to men, everyone is shocked. Janet expresses her desire to experience living with a typical family so Joanna takes Janet to the Wildings\u2019 household. Janet meets their daughter Laura Rose who instantly admires Janet's confidence and independence as a woman. Laura realizes that she is attracted to Janet and begins to pursue a sexual relationship with her. This is transgressive for both of them, as Whileaway's taboo against cross-generational relationships (having a relationship with someone old enough to be your parent or child) is as strong as the taboo against same-sex relationships on Laura's world. The novel then follows Jeannine and Joanna as they accompany Janet back to Whileaway. They meet Vittoria, Janet's wife, and stay at their home. Joanna finds herself under scrutiny when Vittoria uses a story about a bear trapped between two worlds as a metaphor for her life. Jeannine returns to her world with Joanna, and they both go to vacation at her brother's house. Jeannine's mother pesters her about her love life and whether she is going to get married soon. Jeannine goes on a few dates with some men but still finds herself dissatisfied. Jeannine begins to doubt her sense of reality, but soon decides that she wants to assimilate into her role as a woman. She calls Cal and agrees to marry him. Joanna, Jeannine, Janet, and Laura are lounging in Laura's house. Laura tries to glorify Janet's status in Whileaway, but Janet explains that her world does not value her particularly, but chose her as inter-dimensional explorer because she was more expendable than others (\"I am stupid,\" she explains). At 3 a.m., Joanna comes down, unable to sleep, and finds Jeannine and Janet awake as well. Suddenly they are no longer at Laura's house but in another world. Joanna, Jeannine, and Janet have arrived in Jael's world which is experiencing a 40-year-old war between male and female societies. Jael explains that she works for the Bureau of Comparative Ethnology, an organization that concentrates on people's various counterparts in different parallel worlds. She reveals that she is the one who brought all of them together because they are essentially \u201cfour versions of the same woman\u201d (p. 162). Jael takes all of them with her into enemy territory because she appears to be negotiating a deal with one of the male leaders. At first, the male leader appears to be promoting equality, but Jael quickly realizes that he still believes in the inferiority of women. Jael reveals herself as a ruthless assassin, kills the man, and shuttles all of the women back to her house. Jael finally tells the other women why she has assembled all of them. She wants to create bases in the other women's worlds without the male society knowing and eventually empower women to overthrow oppressive men and their gender roles for women. In the end, Jeannine and Joanna agree to help Jael and assimilate the women soldiers into their worlds, but Janet refuses, given the overall pacifism of Whileaway. Jeannine and Joanna appear to have become stronger individuals and are excited to rise up against their gender roles. Janet is not moved by Jael's intentions so Jael tells Janet that the reason for the absence of men on Whileaway is not because of a plague but because the women won the war and killed all of the men in its timeline's past. Janet refuses to believe Jael, and the other women are annoyed at Janet's resistance. The novel ends with the women separating and returning to their worlds, each with a new perspective on her life, her world, and her identity as a woman. Jeannine Dadier is a librarian who lives in a world that never escaped the Great Depression. She believes that \u201cthere is a barrier between [her] and real life which can be removed only by a man or marriage\u201d (p. 120). She doubts her boyfriend Cal's ability to make her happy, yet eventually she succumbs and becomes engaged to him. At the end of the novel, Jeannine appears to have broken from the expectations of marriage and welcomes the social revolution against men. Joanna, living in the 1970s, comes from a world remarkably similar to Earth. The feminist movement has just begun, and Joanna is determined to refute her world's belief that women are inferior to men. Joanna is witty and smart; however, she struggles to assert her abilities and intelligence among her male peers. She repeatedly refers to herself as the \u201cfemale man\u201d (p. 5) to indicate her adoption of the male gender role and separate herself from being identified as just another woman. Janet Evason Belin comes from a futuristic world called Whileaway where all the men died of a gender specific plague over 800 years ago. She is a Safety and Peace officer, similar to a police officer, and has just become an emissary to other worlds. She is married to Vittoria and has two children. In addition to being confident and assertive, Janet is perhaps the most independent from men because she has never experienced patriarchal domination. Alice Jael Reasoner, often referred to as Jael, is an assassin living in a world where a 40-year-old war has caused men and women to separate into warring societies. She is a radical and does not appeal much to her emotion but, focuses solely on facts as they are presented to her. Jael is the instigator behind the four women's meeting and appears to be proposing a revolution against all men. Laura Rose is the daughter in the family that Janet stays with when she is visiting Joanna's world. She proclaims herself to be a \u201cvictim of penis envy,\u201d frustrated that she must stifle her potential in order to become a housewife (p. 65). Janet's confidence and independence from men fascinates Laura, and Laura begins to pursue a sexual relationship with her. Laura is the only character other than the four major ones to have the narrative told through her perspective. Cal is Jeannine's boyfriend and soon-to-be fianc\u00e9. Jeannine does not believe that Cal is masculine enough to provide for her. Mrs. Dadier is Jeannine's mother who lives with Jeannine's brother and his family. When Jeannine spends a vacation at her brother's house, Mrs. Dadier plagues Jeannine with lectures regarding the importance of marriage. The novel is divided into nine parts, with each further divided into chapters. The sections of the novel are usually dedicated to one character's perspective, but often the point of view changes between the four characters and skips from location and time. For example, part five begins in Jeannine's world yet the narrative is through Joanna's perspective. The novel never clearly indicates who is speaking and, as a result, often creates confusion in the narration. The novel does provide clues, however, so that the reader can infer the identity of the narrator. Joanna, Janet, and Jael's perspectives are expressed through the first person narrative, but they often refer to themselves in the third person while the narration is still through their point of view. Jeannine's perspective is initially told solely through a third person narrative. Jeannine does eventually adopt a first person narrative, indicating her emerging doubt of her dependence on a man and her fate as a dutiful wife. Joanna recognizes that her own style of narration reflects a feminine quality. Joanna says, \u201cI have no structure\u2026my thoughts seep out shapelessly like menstrual fluid, it is all very female and deep and full of essences, it is very primitive and full of \u2018and\u2019s,\u2019 it is called \u2018run-on sentences\u2019\u201d (p. 137). Joanna also inserts common conversations in the form of a script that demonstrate her frustration with men\u2019s ignorance of women. Janet often gives background history on Whileaway to provide insight on the nature of her world. Jael is slightly introduced in part two, signaled by an italicized text; however, her story begins in part eight with a repetition of the italicized chapter. The novel mostly focuses on Jael\u2019s perspective until the end of the novel except for a few moments when the narrative is told through the other three\u2019s point of view. As the feminist movement began to gain attention, however, many regarded the novel as one of the most influential works in feminist literature and its wide acceptance heralded the start of feminist science fiction. Elizabeth Lynn, of the San Francisco Review of books, described it as \"A stunning book, a work to be read with great respect. It\u2019s also screamingly funny\". Transgender activists have noted that the Jael sections are transphobic, something that Russ apologized for later in life. The character Janet, and a different version of Whileaway (a planet colonized from Earth, rather than a future version of Earth itself), exist in both the novel The Female Man and in the short story \"When It Changed\". Joanna alludes to Grendel's mother to demonstrate that a woman can be both a nurturing mother and an aggressive, strong woman. Joanna references Mill when she lists the many examples of how men have historically oppressed women. Jael is named after Yael, who kills Sisera by driving a tent peg through his skull while he sleeps. At one point Russ describes Jael in words paraphrased from the Book of Judges: \"At her feet he bowed, he fell, he lay down: at her feet he bowed, he fell: where he bowed, there he fell down dead\" (Jdg. 5:27). Russ's novel refers to the problematic issues in the 1970s when the feminist movement became highly influential. Because The Female Man was written during the 1970s, the character Joanna's world is most similar to the world the author lived in. The novel also addresses the environmental movement as shown through Janet's utopian society. Though Janet's world is extremely technologically advanced, the women choose to live in agrarian societies. Whileaway forms an idealistic image of an organic environment where nature is preserved despite the radical development of technology. Joanna (the author) also mentions the Great Depression, which started in 1929 when the world's economy was plunged into a long and deep recession. In Jeannine's world, however, the Great Depression never ended. The text suggests that the continuation of the Great Depression forced women to seek husbands for financial support and prohibited women from finding jobs of their own, perpetuating gender roles. After having been nominated for the 1975 Nebula Award for Best Novel, The Female Man won one of three Retrospective Tiptree Awards in 1996. It also won a 2002 Gaylactic Spectrum Hall of Fame Award.\n",

His last assignment was as the Principal Deputy Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Haiti and second in command of the UN Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH). He died together with his superior, Tunisian H\u00e9di Annabi, in the 2010 Haiti earthquake. On 18 January 2010, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and several high-ranking UN officials traveled from New York to Port-au-Prince to see the devastation firsthand. Mr. Ban hosted a small memorial service with both men's families at the airport in Port-au-Prince. Costa received his M.A. in international business and political science from New York University in 1978., he was married with two children. Costa was the highest ranking Brazilian in the United Nations. After Costa's death, he was described by United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon as \"a legend of UN peacekeeping operations\" and \"a mentor to generations of UN staff\". Due to his nationality and prominence in the UN hierarchy, Costa had been compared to S\u00e9rgio Vieira de Mello, who was also killed during a peacekeeping mission. Costa joined the United Nations in 1969. At United Nations headquarters in New York City, his work included jobs in the Office of Human Resources Management and what was then the Department of Conference Services. From 1992 to 2000, he was Chief of Personnel Management and Support Service, Field Administration and Logistics Division, Department of Peacekeeping Operations (DPKO), also in New York City. Costa was Director of Administration at the United Nations Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) twice: from July 2000 to August 2001, and from November 2002 to June 2003. Between those terms, he was Principal Officer for Change Management in the Office of the Under-Secretary-General for Peacekeeping Operations. After UNMIK, Costa was Director of the Logistics Support Division of the Office of Mission Support (OMS), again in DPKO in New York City, from 2003 to 2005. His final assignment before Haiti was Deputy Special Representative for Operations and Rule of Law for Liberia, part of the United Nations Mission in Liberia (UNMIL), from September 2005 to November 2006. Costa was appointed Principal Deputy Special Representative for the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH) from 15 November 2006. At the time, there were disagreements between Edmond Mulet from Guatemala, head of the mission, and Brazilian General Jos\u00e9 Elito, the MINUSTAH military commander. In 2007, Elito was replaced by general Carlos Alberto dos Santos Cruz and Mulet was replaced by Tunisian H\u00e9di Annabi. Annabi and Costa continued in their positions until their deaths from the collapse of the Hotel Christopher in Port-au-Prince during the 2010 Haiti earthquake on. The bodies of Costa and Annabi were found on, bringing the earthquake's Brazilian death toll to 17 as of that date.\n",

        "reference": " Injuries due to slips and trips on level floors are a major cause of accidental injury or death. Bad practice in floor cleaning is itself a major cause of accidents. To beautify the floor. To remove stains, dirt, litter and obstructions. To remove grit and sand which scratch and wear down the surface. To remove allergens, in particular dust. To prevent wear to the surface (e.g. by using a floor wax or protective sealant). To make the environment sanitary (e.g. in kitchens). To maintain an optimum traction (e.g. for dance floors). The treatment needed for different types of floors is very different. Slipping is a common safety hazard for cleaning methods that involve water or other liquids, especially if the floor is left wet. Sawdust is used on some floors to absorb any liquids that fall rather than trying to prevent them being spilt. The sawdust is swept up and replaced each day. This was common in the past in pubs and is still used in some butchers and fishmongers. It used to be common to use tea leaves to collect dirt from carpets and remove odours. There are also a wide variety of floor cleaning machines available today such as floor buffers, automatic floor scrubbers and sweepers, and carpet extractors that can deep clean almost any type of hard floor or carpeted flooring surface in much less time than it would take using a traditional cleaning method. Different types of wood flooring may require completely different care depending on whether they are waxed, oiled or have a polyurethane coating. It is important to determine the type of finish of a wood floor and always treat it in the proper manner, for instance it is difficult to clear wood floor wax from a floor coated with polyurethane. Clear the floor of any furniture that is easy to move. Sweep or vacuum all loose dirt and debris. Mop the floor, going along with the grain. For a polyurethane coated floor, dampen a mop with water and a few drops of dishwashing liquid. Be sure to ring out the mop thoroughly before using it on the floor. Run the mop back and forth, going with the grain of the wood in smooth strokes. Do not use water for lacquered or shellacked floors, as it can stain the wood and cause buckling. Buff the floor with a soft cloth to remove any soapy residue. Cloth diapers work well for buffing since they are very soft and absorbent. Tile and stone flooring is common in kitchens, stairs, and bathrooms. Dirt or dust should first be removed with a vacuum cleaner or a broom. Have a floor cleaning solution or spray bottle for the appropriate floor. If  you are cleaning stone floors (marble, granite, travertine, etc. ), make sure the cleaning agent states that it is for stones. After spraying the tile or stone floors in a small area, use a mop to clean and scrub floors. Then wipe it with dry cloth. Vinyl composition tile or VCT is a common commercial floor type. Cleaning this type of floor is done with either a mop and bucket or with a floor scrubber. VCT requires a polymer coating or floor finish to protect it. This needs to be kept clean with dust mopping and wet cleaning (i.e. wet mopping or floor scrubber). A well-maintained entrance matting can dramatically reduce the need for cleaning. For public and office buildings, about 80 to 90% of the dirt is tracked in from outside. Installing a total of 15 feet of matting consisting of both indoor and outdoor sections will remove about 80% of this. Thus, about two-thirds of the dirt can be removed at the entrance.\n",

Film screenings take place at the Prince Music Theater, the Wilma Theater, and several other locations that differ from year to year. It takes place for two weeks annually in mid-July and shows as many as 200 films from more than 40 countries. There is a juried competition for best features and shorts (gay male and lesbian) as well as audience awards, selected by the viewers. In 2014, QFest was canceled for the first year since its founding in 1995. Due to lack of fundraising and the unavailability of Raymond Murray to lead the film programming, the festival was postponed and then canceled for the year.

In these nine days, he had shot the driver Hermann Zwyssig, the postman Emil Stoll and the policeman Alois von Moos. After being held in several prisons in different cantons, the cantonal court of Obwalden sentenced him to death on 19 September 1940. Appeal and a request for clemency were rejected. In view of the fact that the death penalty in Switzerland was already scheduled to be abolished on 1 January 1942, the judgment was controversial. One month later, on the morning of 18 October 1940, Hans Vollenweider was executed in Sarnen in the workshop of the prison with a guillotine borrowed from Lucerne.

        "reference": " (\"a woman from Bulacan\"), is the Spanish title of an 1895 painting by Filipino painter and revolutionary activist Juan Novicio Luna. Bulacan is a province in the Philippines in Luzon island and its residents are called Bulaque\u00f1os, also spelled as Bulakenyos (Bulakenyo for men and Bulakenya for women) in the Filipino language. It is a \"serene portrait\", of a Filipino woman wearing a Mar\u00eda Clara gown, a traditional Filipino dress that is composed of four pieces, namely the camisa, the saya (long skirt), the pa\u00f1uelo (neck cover), and the tapis (knee-length overskirt). The name of the dress is an eponym to Mar\u00eda Clara, the mestiza heroine of Filipino hero Jos\u00e9 Rizal's novel Noli Me Tangere. The woman's clothing in the painting is the reason why the masterpiece is alternately referred to as Mar\u00eda Clara. It is one of the few canvases done by Luna illustrating Filipino culture. The painting is displayed at the National Museum of Fine Arts. Filipino art experts, historians, and researchers have four recommendations on the identity of the woman depicted in Luna's La Bulaque\u00f1a despite the absence of photographs. According to E.A. Cruz, a columnist for the Philippine Daily Globe newspaper, the woman in the portrait could be one of the women courted by Luna after losing his wife Mar\u00eda de la Paz Pardo de Tavera. Luna killed his wife and mother-in-law because of jealousy. The woman could also be a woman courted by Juan Luna's brother, Antonio Luna. Two existing references suggested that it was the daughter of a prominent Filipino family who Luna was not able to marry or, as mentioned earlier, a woman wooed by Luna's brother, Antonio. The two books suggested that the woman was one of the daughters of Do\u00f1a Mariquita Sabas who lived in 2 Espeleta Street, Binondo, Manila, a place frequented by Luna himself and his brother Antonio for tertulia gatherings. Do\u00f1a Sabas had two daughters, namely Dolores nicknamed Loleng and Francisca monickered Paquita. It was Dolores who is believed most likely to be the woman portrayed in Luna's La Bulaque\u00f1a. However, according to Rosalinda Orosa, the owner of Luna's other painting, the Tampuhan, the woman could be Emiliana Trinidad, Orosa's ancestor and the same woman who was the sitter for Luna's Tampuhan painting. According to Dr. Asunci\u00f3n N. Fernando, the woman could be Mar\u00eda \"Iyang\" Rodrigo Fernando, Asunci\u00f3n Fernando's own grandmother who assisted in the cause of the Katipunan. Mar\u00eda Rodrigo Fernando was the bringer of food and courier of messages to Katipuneros hiding in the fields outside her hometown. Historian Antonio Valeriano noted that the woman in the portrait has similar facial features of the Rodrigos which include the \"bushy eyebrows and sad eyes\" such as that of Francisco \"Soc\" Rodrigo. Belen Ponferrada of the Museum of Malaca\u00f1ang conforms with the findings of the research regarding the woman's possible identity.\n",

        "prefix": "Leland Joseph \"Lee\" Adama (callsign \"Apollo\") is a fictional character in the television series Battlestar Galactica. He",
        "reference": " is portrayed by actor Jamie Bamber, and is one of the main characters in the series. Lee Adama was born to William Adama, a veteran of the First Cylon War, and his wife, Carolanne Adama. He also had a younger brother, Zak Adama. Their father strongly encouraged both boys to enter the Colonial Fleet and become Viper pilots. Unfortunately, Zak was not a natural pilot like his brother and father, and was killed in an accident after being awarded flight status against the better judgment of his flight instructor and fianc\u00e9e, then-Lieutenant Kara \"Starbuck\" Thrace. Zak's death drove a wedge between Lee Adama and his father which would only be healed over two years later, after the Destruction of the Twelve Colonies. By the time of the Cylons' devastating attack on the Twelve Colonies, Lee Adama is a Captain in the Colonial Fleet Reserve with the call sign \"Apollo\". He is a special guest at the decommissioning ceremonies for Battlestar Galactica, commanded by his father. After Major Jackson \"Ripper\" Spencer, the Galactica's CAG (Commander of the Air Group) is killed in battle, Lee Adama becomes senior surviving pilot, then joins the Galactica crew and becomes its CAG. Lee Adama's strained relationship with his father also causes him to become a strong supporter of Colonial President Laura Roslin, who often butts heads with William Adama. Roslin, unfamiliar with the military, appoints Lee Adama to be her personal advisor. Early in their relationship, President Laura Roslin often referred to Lee Adama as \"Captain Apollo\". Lee once corrected her, stating \"Apollo\" was his call sign, but President Roslin replied \"'Captain Apollo' has a nice ring to it\". Upon joining Galactica'''s crew, Apollo was a bit of an outsider but after proving himself in several missions as more than just the \"old man's son\" he earned the respect of his fellow pilots and soon became one of the crew. When Kara Thrace goes missing after being shot down over an unnamed red moon, Lee is at the forefront of the search for the missing pilot. Lee and his father are ultimately compelled to abandon the search for Starbuck after President Roslin alerts them to how they are placing personal feelings above the good of the fleet. Fortunately, Starbuck is able to return to Galactica using a Cylon Raider she shot down. However, the incident cements the father-son bond between William Adama and his surviving son. Lee questions how long his father would search for him, were he missing, to which the elder Adama responds, \"If it were you, we'd never leave\". Lee is part of the strike team sent by then-Commander Adama to Colonial One to terminate Laura Roslin's presidency after she encourages Kara Thrace to abscond with a captured Cylon Raider. On board Colonial One, Lee has a change of heart, declaring that it isn't worth it to sacrifice democracy. He puts his gun to Colonel Saul Tigh's head. Tigh calmly tells Lee, \"This is mutiny, you know that\". Tigh takes control of the situation after Roslin surrenders and is able to take both Roslin and Lee into custody. Lee is present in the Galactica's CIC shortly thereafter, when the Cylon infiltrator known as Lieutenant Junior Grade Sharon \"Boomer\" Valerii shoots Commander Adama twice in the chest; despite his disagreement with his father over deposing Roslin, he tries to comfort his father after being shot. On Tigh's orders, Lee is physically dragged from his father's side and thrown in the brig. Needing Lee's services as CAG, Tigh later releases Lee on parole. Lee will perform his duties as before, but \"make no attempt to free [Roslin] or sow insurrection among the crew\", and will return to the brig when not on duty. Nonetheless, Lee breaks his parole after Tigh's leadership takes a disastrous turn and results in civilian deaths. He helps Roslin to lead a breakaway fleet to Kobol. After Commander Adama and President Roslin make a personal effort to heal the divisions in the fleet, Lee returns to duty on Galactica. Lee is one of the five people who see firsthand the map to Earth in the Tomb of Athena on Kobol. After the Battlestar Pegasus joins the fleet, Lee is temporarily transferred to the Pegasus, given duties flying Raptors rather than Vipers, and even demoted to Lieutenant. All of these misfortunes are reversed after the successful attack on the Cylon Resurrection ship, the death of Rear Admiral Helena Cain, and his father's promotion to flag rank. However, Lee battles with depression at this time, confessing to Kara Thrace \"he didn't want to make it back alive\". While on leave on the Cloud 9 luxury liner, Lee is accidentally shot by Kara Thrace during a hostage rescue. He takes almost a month to recover from this wound, during which time he is promoted to Major and consummates his long-simmering relationship with Petty Officer Second Class Anastasia Dualla. He is assigned to Pegasus to assist the new commanding officer, Commander Barry Garner. After he successfully commands the ship during a Cylon surprise attack in which Garner is killed, Lee is quickly promoted from Major to Commander, and given command of Pegasus. Shortly before the Roslin-vs. -Baltar presidential election, the fleet discovers a somewhat habitable planet inside of a nebula, presumably safe from Cylon discovery, which is named New Caprica. After Gaius Baltar wins the  presidential election, he orders the establishment of permanent settlements on the planet. The Galactica and Pegasus begin a monotonous orbital defense patrol. Months later, Lee and Kara Thrace both get drunk at a party celebrating the ceremonial first shovelful of earth being dug on New Caprica. They make love, declare their love for one another, and fall asleep together; however, Kara wakes first and leaves. When Lee wakes and returns to the settlement he finds Kara has married Samuel Anders. This betrayal causes a lot of bad feeling between Adama and Thrace. He takes to overeating and puts on a lot of weight; he also marries his new first officer, Anastasia Dualla, now a Lieutenant Junior Grade. Eight months later the Cylons find New Caprica, and take control over the colonists. With only a skeleton crew manning his ship, Lee is forced to flee with the rest of the fleet hoping to return again to fight off the Cylons and save the civilian population. Four months later still, as the Galactica and Pegasus lay plans to rescue the civilians trapped on New Caprica, the psychological impact of the past year is also obvious: after previously being in great physical shape, Lee has become overweight, sentimental and \"soft\", to the point where it interferes with his ability to command the Pegasus. When contact with the resistance movement on New Caprica is established, Lee is ordered by his father to take the Pegasus and continue the search for Earth while the Galactica attempts to liberate the planet. When Galactica is near destruction, Lee and Pegasus come to the rescue, giving his father's ship time to jump out. Under heavy fire from four Cylon Basestars, the Pegasus is heavily damaged, having left its Vipers to defend the rest of the fleet. Lee orders the crew to abandon ship, saying \"Thank You\" to his ship just as he departs. The Pegasus rams a Cylon basestar, instantly destroying both vessels, and a large piece of wreckage damages or destroys a second basestar. Lee's first role after the rescue of the civilian population appears to be connected to conducting some kind of head-count or census of the rescued civilians. It is in this capacity he notices  certain confirmed survivors have gone missing, having been executed by The Circle for collaborating with the Cylons. He then returns to the role of Galactica's CAG, with the rank of Major. After much hard physical training, he loses the excess weight he gained over the previous year and asks Captain Karl \"Helo\" Agathon to remind him to never let himself go like that again. Lee advocates using captured Cylons infected with a strain of lymphocytic encephalitis as biological weapons to exterminate the Cylon race. His plan is approved by President Roslin, but is thwarted by Captain Karl \"Helo\" Agathon, the Galactica's executive officer at the time. The renewed strength of his bond with his father is shown when his father chooses to confess to Lee about his fears he may have inadvertently provoked the Cylon onslaught on the Colonies. However, that father-son relationship sours following the death of Kara Thrace, whom Lee loved and whom Adama considered as close as a daughter. While both grieve, Lee is visibly shaken by the death, while Adama does his best to move past it. When Adama realizes his son has become unhinged by her death, he pulls him from flight duty, assigning Lee the task of heading up the security detail for the defense attorney of Gaius Baltar, whose trial Adama considers to be little more than a public relations exercise. Lee suspects his father is being overprotective, not wishing to lose him as he did Kara. After two assassination attempts on Baltar's latest lawyer, Romo Lampkin, the culprit is discovered. Adama then reinstates Lee as CAG, not wanting to expose him to the dangers of more potential assassination attempts. Lee, however, has become very interested in Colonial law at this point, after reading some of his grandfather's law books, and believes he could assist Lampkin prepare the case. Adama resists, but Lee refuses to resume his duties as CAG, and joins the legal team. As the trial begins, Admiral Adama is enraged to find that Saul Tigh, now a witness, is forced to admit he killed his own wife on New Caprica. He blames Lee, believing his son has given the information to Lampkin. Adama wants Lee to stop helping Baltar, but Lee refuses, ultimately resigning his commission after Adama openly states that Lee has no integrity, and that he is \"a coward\" for supposedly letting Romo question Saul. Putting the uniform behind him, Lee begins to see the trial more as an exercise of justice rather than as a trial of a specific man, and personally takes up the cross-examination of President Laura Roslin, confronting her with her renewed use of the hallucinogenic compound chamala-extract which she claims is a treatment for her relapse of cancer. This move, while justified in Lee's mind toward preserving justice in the fleet, further strains his relationship with both his father and Roslin, and motivates his wife to finally leave him. After Laura's deposition, Lee is the last witness called, following Felix Gaeta's perjury in stating President Baltar willingly signed a mass execution warrant. Lee proclaims in court  nearly all those in positions of power throughout the Fleet, including himself, are guilty of murder and treason to some degree; because Baltar is broadly reviled in Fleet society, human civilization is scapegoating the ex-President in an effort to expunge its guilt and shame. Lee ultimately realizes he was being manipulated by Lampkin, who boldly predicted to Baltar he has no greater ally than a son trying to flee his father's shadow. After Baltar's acquittal, the Fleet is once again discovered by the Cylons. Despite having resigned his commission, Lee puts on a flight suit and pilots Viper 3 to help defend the fleet from the Cylons. While in flight he spots something on his wing, which he discovers to be a Viper, flown by Kara Thrace. She proceeds to tell him \"It's okay, don't freak out, it's really me. I've been to Earth, I know where it is, and I'm gonna take us there\". While reviewing his gun camera footage, Lee tells his father that since Baltar's trial, he feels he can do more outside the military, even as his father offers to return his wings. Adama is visibly upset but ultimately concedes to his son's wishes. At Lee's \"mustering out\" party, he drinks several toasts to the Galactica, his friends, Rear Admiral Adama, the Fleet and \"to absent friends\". As he leaves the Galactica, the pilots and Command staff salute him while he boards the Raptor taking him off the ship. Dualla gives him his Viper wings in a frame and as he hugs her he says, \"Well, looks like you get the house\". Lee begins his political career as the Caprica Delegate to the Quorum of Twelve. Following the disappearance of President Roslin aboard the defecting Cylon basestar, Lee searches for an alternative Presidential candidate to the still-divisive Zarek. After a tense confrontation with a despairing Romo Lampkin, during which he is informed of his nomination with a gun to the head, Lee accepts his candidacy. Aboard Colonial One, Lee Adama is inaugurated as the Acting President of the Twelve Colonies of Kobol. After his father's return to Galactica, President Adama is faced with a hostage crisis instigated by the Cylon D'Anna. She demands the Four Cylons within the Colonial fleet reveal themselves and find their way to the Rebel baseship; until then, a Colonial hostage on the baseship would be killed every 15 minutes. His father's nervous breakdown in the light of Tigh's confession gave Lee the upper hand. Within short order, he had three of the final five standing in an airlock. D'Anna was backed hopelessly into a corner and prepared to nuke the civilian fleet; the confrontation seemed hopeless until Starbuck showed up with the co-ordinates to Earth. Lee felt withholding the information would only serve to prolong a pointless war, so shared the discovery with D'Anna. He saw to it Cylon and Human would travel to Earth and make a new home together. The Fleet's arrival at Earth was a bittersweet experience for Adama. Joy, elation and relief quickly turned to dismay and horror upon witnessing a devastated cityscape once the thirteenth colony. After returning to Galactica, Lee and his ex-wife Anastasia Dualla share a reconciliation and go on a \"date\". After Lee departs, Dualla shoots herself, wishing to hold onto the reconciliation as her last memory. In the wake of Tom Zarek's failed coup, Lee is appointed Vice President of the Colonies by President Laura Roslin, and it is made clear while she will retain the title of President, Lee will handle the \"heavy lifting\". When Admiral Adama decides to lead a possibly one-way rescue mission for Hera and asks for volunteers, Lee is the first to step forward. He leads one of the assault teams straight into the Colony to retrieve Hera and manages to return her safely to the Galactica. When the fleet reaches the second Earth, Lee is the one to propose the survivors abandon their ships and technology and take the chance to break the cycle of violence and start life with a clean slate. The survivors agree to the plan and willingly allow the fleet to be destroyed while they settle on Earth with nothing but the clothes on their back and the supplies they possess. With a new chance at life, Lee expresses interest in exploring the new planet. William Adama: Lee's father and current commander of the fleet and Galactica. Although strained at the beginning, his relationship with his son has evolved into a mutual love and respect. Lee then quit his role as CAG to defend Baltar full-time and was on very bad terms with Bill Adama. Following the trial, the two reconciled; Lee being offered the opportunity to return to the service. Kara Thrace:  Although the extent of his relationship with Kara Thrace, callsign Starbuck, before joining Galactica has never fully been explained, they share one of the strongest bonds on the show. It is revealed in the series finale Lee met Kara while she was dating Zak Adama. The three had a dinner party in Kara's apartment, and a drunken Kara dared Lee to make love to her while Zak was passed out on the sofa. The two stopped themselves when Zak briefly woke, but it is clear the attraction between Lee and Kara existed from the beginning of their friendship. Aboard Galactica, the two often have a volatile relationship, both professionally and personally. They almost consummated their relationship in \"Scar\", and have often been known to be jealous of each other's lovers. While not on good terms since finally sleeping together on New Caprica, their relationship seems to have improved since facing off in an emotional boxing match in \"Unfinished Business\". In the beginning of season 3 Lee and Kara seem to be on the verge of a serious relationship until Kara suddenly gets married. This does not put a stop to the tension between the characters; however, Lee won't cheat on his wife, Dee, and Kara doesn't want to divorce her husband, Anders, saying  divorce is a sin in \"The Eye of Jupiter\". After Kara returns from the dead at the beginning of season 4, Lee supports her claims she can lead the fleet to Earth. Aside from a brief kiss during the mutiny aboard Galactica, Lee and Kara's relationship is not explored much during the final season, although the two characters share a final scene together in the series finale, with Kara mysteriously disappearing when Lee briefly looks away from her. Laura Roslin: President of the Colonies. Appointed Lee as her military advisor in Season 1. Over the course of the show Lee has consistently sided with Roslin over his father, most notably when he refused to arrest her for defying his father's orders and later when he defected with her and nearly a third of the fleet to go to Kobol. Since then, however, their relationship has deteriorated. Assigned to Gaius Baltar's security during his trial for the crimes committed on New Caprica, Lee takes an active interest in Baltar's defense to the point of questioning Laura Roslin himself when the President took the stand. In an attempt to undermine her credibility, Lee forced the President to confess she had resumed taking chamalla, the hallucinogenic alternative cancer therapy. While Lee's reasoning was the President had become addicted, a disappointed and betrayed Roslin was forced to reveal her cancer had in fact returned. In Season 4, Lee resigns his post as CAG and takes up a position as Quorum Delegate for Caprica, which finds his idealism conflicting with Roslin's more totalitarian and secretive approach to fleet politics. However, Lee gains Roslin's respect with his handling of the hostage situation created by D'Anna as the acting president, with her saying his duty to the fleet is not over and the human race will need people like Lee Adama to lead them in the coming days. Anastasia Dualla: Former communications NCO on Galactica. She was  Lee Adama's executive officer aboard Pegasus and after forming a relationship with Lee, she married him. Later, Dee left her husband after he took a job on Baltar's defense team and relentlessly attacked Laura Roslin on the stand, forcing her to reveal her chamalla use. After the discovery of the planet originally called Earth, Lee and Dee briefly reestablished their relationship. However, this does not stop the depressed Dee from committing suicide after Earth is found to be unsuitable for colonization. Lee is deeply shaken by her death, and knows that he will ultimately never understand her reasons for suicide. Although her decision was never explained onscreen, a deleted scene from the episode Unfinished Business indicated Dee was aware of Lee's 'love and connection' with Kara Thrace. Romo Lampkin: Defense attorney (specifically a public defender) and prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Lee's grandfather Joseph (himself a public defender). Lampkin's approach in developing Gaius Baltar's defense intrigues Lee and causes him to become Lampkin's bodyguard. Later, Lampkin's philosophical prodding on the nature of justice, as well as stories about Joseph Adama's career and personality encourage Lee to resign from the Fleet and become the Caprican representative on the Quorum of Twelve. Gianne: Lee's fianc\u00e9e from Caprica who presumably died during the Cylon attacks. Lee holds residual guilt for leaving her behind, and for running out on her when he found out she was pregnant with his child prior to the Cylon attacks. Shevon: A prostitute from Cloud 9'' with whom Lee had relations. Lee tried to ease his guilt over what happened with Gianne by trying to save Shevon and her daughter Paya.\n",

        "reference": " commonly known as Yahei or Yah\u00e9e (\u5f25\u5175\u885e Yahee). His second daughter Mineko was married to \u014ckubo Toshimichi's second son Makino Nobuaki. His son Yatar\u014d Mishima was an eighth-generation custodian of the Bank of Japan, while his grandson Michiharu Mishima served as the fourth Chief Scout of the Scout Association of Japan. In 1874, Mishima became the Ordinance of Sakata Prefecture. The focus of this new post soon turned to countermeasures aimed at an agrarian-sector demonstration known as the Wappa Rebellion. This was a peasant protest opposed to a failure on the part of the ordinance and government officials, who had come from being lords and vassals during the feudal era, to uphold a central edict and thereby imposing labour and taxes identical to those of the previous period. Mishima thus embarked on a full-scale reshuffling of all clerks and officials whilst simultaneously dealing with pressure from the agrarian sector. That following year the protests had been settled through the courts with the money returned to the farmers. In August 1875, Sakata Prefecture became Uruoka Prefecture; the following year it became Yamagata Prefecture through the merging of Okitama (also Oitama) and Yamagata prefectures. Accordingly, Mishima became Ordinance of both Uruoka and Yamagata prefectures. Mishima's central policy for Yamagata was the maintenance of roads and bridges and the building of public facilities. During the Edo period, the Yamagata region formed a strong bond with Osaka, even more so than with Edo, due to shipping routes via the Sea of Japan and Mogami River. However, when land-based transportation was emphasised as an objective of the Meiji era government, traffic control on land routes were progressed so as to form ties with Tokyo. Firstly, allowance was made for the Kuriko Highway between Yonezawa and Fukushima, which was completed in 1880. Then, in 1882 the Sekiyama Highway between Yamagata and Sendai was completed. Both these routes were constructed to allow for vehicles (or, in those days, horse-carriages). In 1884, whilst serving as Ordinance of Tochigi, members of the Liberal Party plotted for Mishima's assassination in what became known as the Mount Kaban Incident. Even despite this there is still speculation as to whether any pressure from Mishima somehow proved to be an obstacle to any Freedom and People's Rights Movements. On December 25, 1887, Mishima as Superintendent General brought to execution the Regulations for the Preservation of Law and Order declared publicly by imperial edict, which aimed to remove so-called \"dangerous characters\" from the imperial circles and opposed Freedom and People's Rights Movements such as the (\u4e09\u5927\u4e8b\u4ef6\u5efa\u767d\u904b\u52d5 Sandai Jiken Kempaku Und\u014d) and the United Front Movement. He was also the Superintendent General of the Metropolitan Police who brought to execution the Public Order & Police Law of 1900, the predecessor to the Peace Preservation Law of 1925. It is speculated that with Chancellor It\u014d Hirobumi's opposition to the Regulations for the Preservation of Law and Order and Home Minister Yamagata Aritomo's passive nature at this time, it was Mishima who actively promoted the Regulations for the Preservation of Law and Order. Resultant targets were figures such as Ozaki Yukio, Kataoka Kenkichi, Nakae Ch\u014dmin and Hoshi T\u014dru. Mishima also displayed his enthusiasm for district developments outside the public office through the Ch\u014dk\u014dsha firm in Nasunogahara, Tochigi (known today as Mishima Farms). He recruited his son Yatar\u014d Mishima as managing director and fourteen of his closest subordinates to join the firm as shareholders, ensuring that land cultivation in the area would not succumb to monopolization.\n",

        "reference": " people were Arab tenants, some of whom from the Bedouin tribes of Ka'abiye and Sa'adih. They settled the land during the late 19th century. The land of the village was owned by three Christian families from Beirut and Haifa. The land was purchased by the Yishuv in the 1920s and the villagers began evacuating. Yokneam Moshava and HaZore'a were built on former village land. The occupation of Qira by pre-state Israeli forces on 1 March 1948 finished the evacuation process. At least 19 archaeological sites were located within the village's territory, the most renowned of these being Tell Qira and Tell Qamun. In a map made by Pierre Jacotin during the French campaign in Egypt and Syria, Tell Qamun appeared under the name of Chateau d'El Kireh (Castle of Qira), and Qira appeared as Qairah. In his visit to Qamun and Qira, van de Velde found a church on Qamun, and then he searched for a castle in Qira, but when he arrived to the site, he only found ruins \"which externally presented nothing of importance\". He came to the conclusion Jacotine confounded the tell of Qamun with that of Qira. In 1872 the Ottoman government sold the lands of Qira to the Christian Sursock family from Beirut (modern-day Lebanon) and later their part of the land was shared with the Tueni family, also from Beirut. In that year the PEF's Survey of Western Palestine visited, and noted about Khurbet Kireh \"Evidently an ancient site. There are traces of ruins and broken pottery on the hill; to the north are kokim tombs, caves, and a quarry; to the east are other tombs, caves, quarries, and a rock-cut water channel, Umm el Hashurah. There is a good supply of water in the valley at this point, and a small mill. A colony of Turcomans live in the caves; they pronounce the name Jireh\". The other part of the land was sold to the Khouri family from Haifa. According to Peretz Levinger's study of the establishment of the nearby town of Yokneam Moshava, it is unknown if the villagers came before or after the land was sold to the families. He assumes the Ottomans sold the land when it was uninhabited. The Palestinian community in Qira began during the 19th century. The residents were tenant farmers, paying fees to the families who owned the land. The population was made of two groups: Arab fellaheen, who came from the nearby Arab villages, and Bedouin nomads. The bedouins came from two tribes: Ka'abiye and Sa'adih, who arrived to the land, according to elderly traditions during the 1870s and possibly in the 1860s. At the time they arrived, they consisted of only twelve families. A population list from about 1887 showed that Kireh had about 65 inhabitants; all Muslims. In 1924, Zionist activist Yehoshua Hankin bought the share of the land owned by the Sursock and Tueni families. In February 1934 the remaining share, owned by the Khouri family was bought after a decade of negotiations. The fellaheens were the first to evacuate their lands after receiving compensation and thus the population Qira decreased from 134 in 1922 to 86 in 1931 (in a total of  21  houses). The evacuation of the Bedouin tribes took much longer as they refused to leave their lands, especially after the fellaheens left the better parts of the territory, suitable for the Bedouin lifestyle. It was also delayed because the Arab landowners did not want to take responsibility for the evacuation, due to political reasons. In their lands they grew wheat, barely and sorghum. Further negotiations in 1935 and 1936, including the intervention of influential Arab figures were interrupted by the break of the 1936\u20131939 Arab revolt. The act of selling lands to Jews was seen in the Arab community as treason, punishable by death. After the revolt, both tribes showed interest in the renewal of the negotiations after their leaders no longer felt a threat to their lives. The evacuation continued in 1936 and later that year the rest of the Ka'abiye tribe left. The last evacuation took place in 1945 when the leader of the Sa'adih tribe left for a large amount of money. The last of Qira's Muslim population lived between Yokneam Moshava and HaZore'a. According to Ilan Pappe in The Israel/Palestine Question (1999), the 140 tenant farmers of Qira wa Qamun evacuated the village in March on the \"friendly advice\" of the local Haganah intelligence officer at Yokneam, Yehuda Burstein. Benny Morris notes that Burnstein received the orders for the evacuation from Yosef Weitz. The Haganah Intelligence Report attributes the flight to \"fear and the influence of attacks in the area,\" which Morris notes is \"not really the same thing\". Subsequent to the depopulation of the village, Weitz and his colleagues from the Jewish National Fund in the North, \"decided to raze the tenants' houses, to destroy their crops, and to pay the evictees compensation\". Qira wa Qamun's inhabitants joined the first wave of the 1948 Palestinian exodus, displaced prior to the outbreak of the 1948 Arab-Israeli war. Today, the villagers and their descendants remain refugees. Following the war the area was incorporated into the State of Israel; Yokneam Illit was later established on the former lands of Qira.\n",

The team signed an agreement with the North Bay Battalion of the Ontario Hockey League to serve as an official feeder to this squad. Scott Wray, a fifteen-year veteran who skated mainly in the ECHL was chosen as head coach. During the 2014\u201315 season, the Voodoos' first in the league, the club finished with a 15\u201329\u20130\u20138 record. In only their second year of operation the Voodoos claimed their first regular season Division Championship. In their third year the team repeated as regular season division champions and added the overall regular season league champions and they swept the Blind River Beavers in four games in the finals to advance to the Dudley Hewitt Cup. They finished the round-robin with a record of 1\u20132\u20130 and advanced to the semifinals, which they lost to the Georgetown Raiders with a score of 2\u20131. Prior to the 2017\u201318 season, Scott Wray was promoted to an assistant coach position with the Ontario Hockey League's North Bay Battalion and Beau Moyer was hired as the team's second head coach. However, he would be fired from the team during the season on 29 January following a league imposed suspension after he had violated a league rule involving drinking with a few players. Both Moyer and his father, who was present in the hotel bar, cited that they had not invited the players to the bar, who were of legal drinking age, but that the players came to the bar on their own and then joined the coaches.

        "reference": " son, Raymond McCord Jr., was killed by the loyalist paramilitary group the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) in 1997. He is an outspoken critic of the UVF. McCord, an Ulster Protestant, was born in the unionist York Road area of North Belfast. His family lived at 17 Grove Street until he was two when they moved to a new house in the recently built Rathcoole estate in Newtownabbey. As a youth McCord was educated first at Whitehouse Primary School and subsequently at Belfast High School. During his teenage years he played in an association football team Star of the Sea alongside future Provisional IRA member and hunger striker Bobby Sands. Although the club was nominally Catholic it also had many Protestant youths. Two of McCord's other teammates, Terry Nicholl and Michael Acheson, would both later join the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) and serve time in prison for offences related to their membership. Most of the Protestant players left after the outbreak of the Troubles, although McCord remained and played for the senior side in the Northern Amateur Football League, alongside Marty Quinn. As a 17-year-old he had trials with Manchester United F.C., a club he continues to support, and Blackpool F.C., but was not offered terms by either club and did not pursue a career in football. McCord had worked as a welder at Harland & Wolff and as a bouncer. In 1992 as a result of a dispute with the loyalist paramilitary group the Ulster Defence Association (UDA) he received a vicious beating from six UDA members in Rathcoole. He left Northern Ireland some time after to go to the US, returning in 1995. Upon his return he attempted to address the intimidation of his wife Vivienne and their three children: Raymond, Gareth and Glenn, by the UDA. According to McCord his two youngest sons, who lived with their mother in Rathfern whilst Raymond Jnr. lived with him, were frequent victims of gang attacks from local UDA members. McCord's dispute with the UDA was linked to an incident with prominent UDA member John Gregg. Raymond junior, the oldest of McCord's three sons, was born on 24 November 1974. He joined the Royal Air Force (RAF) in his teens, serving as a radar operator. He left the RAF after four years and returned home to Northern Ireland, where he joined the UVF. McCord senior believed this was to offer his family protection from the Ulster Defence Association (UDA) due to the McCord family's previous trouble with the UDA. McCord junior was attached to the Mount Vernon unit of the UVF and was under the command of Mark Haddock. Mostly involved in drug running operations, McCord junior was caught with a haul of cannabis and arrested. Fearing a rebuke from the UVF Brigade Staff (Belfast leadership) from McCord junior informing the police and the UVF leadership about Haddock's involvement in the drug trade, Haddock allegedly decided to have McCord junior killed. On 9 November 1997 the latter was believed to have been lured from home and taken to a disused quarry in Ballyduff, Newtownabbey where he was beaten to death with concrete blocks. He was 22 at the time of his death. He was buried in Carnmoney Cemetery in Newtownabbey on 14 November 1997. McCord senior initially believed his son had been killed by the UDA as part of the bad blood between that organisation and his family but later had it confirmed by several sources that the UVF had been behind the killing. The UDA South East Antrim Brigade issued a statement acknowledging the history it had with McCord but denied any involvement in his son's death. Angered by the lack of interest by mainstream Unionism and the police investigation McCord carried out his own investigation. Promising to his family to act within the law he used his contacts with loyalism to uncover that Mark Haddock was a police informer. McCord claims he met with UVF Chief of Staff John \"Bunter\" Graham and other leading members of the organisation in the Maze prison, where they were waiting to visit an inmate, soon after his son's killing and that they agreed to conduct the internal investigation that uncovered the information about Haddock. However he further claimed that the inquiry did not target Haddock as some of those involved in it were themselves police informers. McCord discovered that Haddock's status as an informer meant he wasn't questioned or linked to the killing of his son. Telling anyone who would listen to his claims McCord make a decisive breakthrough in 2002 when he met Police Ombudsman Nuala O'Loan. O'Loan conducted an investigation and the results were published in 2007. The investigation was named Operation Ballast, and focused on alleged collusion between the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) and the UVF. The report stated the police colluded with loyalists in over a dozen murders in North Belfast. O'Loan had established that a leading loyalist who was also a police informer had been involved in the killing and in 2005 it was announced in the D\u00e1il by Irish Labour Party leader Pat Rabbitte using parliamentary privilege that the loyalist in question was Mark Haddock. After being dismayed by the reaction of unionist politicians McCord announced his intention to stand for election in the 2007 Northern Ireland assembly elections in his native North Belfast constituency. McCord stated that he took the decision after Jeffrey Donaldson condemned him in a television interview after the publication of the O'Loan Report, questioning why McCord did not report his son to the police for being a UVF member. McCord's manifesto was co-written by Mark Langhammer, with the two being old friends. He subsequently received 1320 votes (4. 4% of the total vote). This was actually McCord's second election as he had also been a candidate in the 2003 election when he captured only 218 votes (0. 7%). In 2008 McCord made history by becoming the first Unionist to address the annual Sinn F\u00e9in Ard Fheis. Wearing his father's Orange Order sash at the event he denounced the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) for ignoring evidence of collusion between the security forces and loyalist paramilitaries. Sinn F\u00e9in previously in 2007 had organised a trip for McCord to attend the European Parliament in Strasbourg to address a meeting of MEP's regarding the issue of collusion in Northern Ireland. McCord had also met Gerry Adams on the Falls Road around this time. McCord was again an independent candidate for North Belfast in the 2011 assembly elections. This time he captured a reduced vote total of 1,176 for a 3. 5% share. He was also an unsuccessful candidate for Belfast City Council in the concurrent local elections, running in the Court District Electoral Area. In December 2013 McCord was with anti-drugs campaigner Tracey Coulter, daughter of Jackie Coulter when Mo Courtney, a leading figure in the UDA West Belfast Brigade and a strong opponent of Tracey Coulter, approached them and verbally abused them, allegedly threatening to kill both McCord and Coulter. Brought to trial for the incident, Courtney was found guilty with issuing the death threat to McCord (although not Coulter). In November 2014 McCord announced his intention to stand for parliament in the 2015 general election. McCord declared that he would run against the DUP's Nigel Dodds in North Belfast, claiming that the DUP had \"let victims down\". Ultimately however he did not contest the election. An opponent of plans for the UK to leave the European Union McCord, who argued that the move would jeopardise stability in Northern Ireland and hit funding for post-Troubles projects, launched a legal challenge against the proposed move in the aftermath of the referendum. He announced his intention to vote for Nichola Mallon of the SDLP in the 2017 Assembly Elections. Despite his Unionist beliefs, he believes Nichola Mallon is best placed to serve all the people of North Belfast and criticised the DUP and Sinn F\u00e9in's divisive approach to politics. He also plans to canvass for People Before Profit in Derry and spoke of his support for Eamonn McCann. McCord was the second child of Hector and Kathleen McCord (n\u00e9e Elliott), his sister Jean being seven years older than him. McCord states that, whilst his father was a member of the Orange Order, the Apprentice Boys of Derry and the Royal Black Institution, he maintained close friendships with his Catholic neighbours in the New Lodge area and, before the advent of the Troubles, regularly drank in the pubs there. Hector McCord died in 1994 aged 70 whilst Kathleen McCord was still alive as of 2008. McCord met his wife Vivienne,  who also lived in Rathcoole, when he was 15. They married in 1973 and set up home in a flat in Rathcoole. The family moved to nearby Rathfern around 1976 and their second son Gareth was born there in 1977. A third son Glenn followed soon afterwards. McCord and his wife split in the 1980s and he returned to live in Rathcoole. He subsequently moved back to York Road. In 2014 McCord was convicted of benefit fraud, pleading guilty to thirteen counts totalling \u00a369,000 in mis-claimed housing benefit, incapacity benefit and industrial injury reduced earnings allowances. He was given a sentence of 18 months imprisonment, suspended for three years.\n",

        "reference": " a golden buckled bowl or cup which is among the pieces of the Treasure of Nagyszentmikl\u00f3s which are now in the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna. The bowl is 12\u00a0cm in diameter and weighs 212 g, and has a handle or buckle, perhaps for hanging on a belt. The inscription is found around the outside of a circular design in the middle of the bowl. In the place where the inscription begins and ends, there is a cross. The inscription reads:. Prevailing opinion is that the language of the text is a Turkic language, and several translations have been proposed, though none are agreed upon. Vilhelm Thomsen translated the inscription: \"Boila zoapan finished this bowl [this drinking cup], which Boutaoul zoapan made suitable for hanging up\". Nikola Mavrodinov translated it: \"Bouila zoapan made this cup; Boutaul Zoapan made this cup suitable for drinking from\". Gyula N\u00e9meth translated it: \"Boila chaban's bowl, which was made to his order; Boutaoul had a buckle made for it, and this is his bowl\". Paul Laz\u0103r Tonciulescu translated it: \"Jupan Buila [has] all rights, jupan Butaul [has the right of] entering [in] all towns. The treasure of Nagyszentmikl\u00f3s, of which the bowl is a part, consists of 23 decorated gold vessels weighing around 10 kg. It was found in 1799 on the banks of the Aranca river, near Nagyszentmikl\u00f3s (today S\u00e2nnicolau Mare in Timi\u0219 County, Romania), in the region of Avar settlement in the Carpathian Basin. It was also attributed to the lower Danube Bulgars, but the current view is that the treasure is of Avar origin and closely related to the Avar culture. The objects were made by specialized craftsmen in the 7th and 8th centuries and were hoarded by local lords. The treasure was last \"used\" and buried in the second half of the 8th century or perhaps in the early 9th century. Some of the vessels bear runiform inscriptions. Similar characters can be found on a bone needle case excavated in the Late Avar cemetery of Szarvas (in B\u00e9k\u00e9s County, Hungary) and dated to the second half of the 8th century. Based on this evidence, some scholars proposed a similar date for the Nagyszentmikl\u00f3s inscriptions. The Buyla inscription is engraved in Greek letters on the inner bottom of a round buckled bowl (no. 21 in J\u00f3zsef Hampel's list), on a flat ring surrounding a lavishly decorated disk. Some of the letters of the inscription have distinctive shapes. The letters sigma and epsilon have broad arcs. The  base line of delta juts out on both sides. Beta has also a prominent base line, a form found in the Greek inscriptions from Bulgaria dated to the early 9th century, but otherwise it is rarely attested in the Greek-writing world: only on several Cherson coins of the Byzantine emperor Basil I (867-886) and also on one inscription of the same emperor, found in Mesembria (today Nesebar, Bulgaria). The shape of alpha is also attested on the 9th century Greek inscriptions from Bulgaria. On the other hand, omega's unusual shape, with a middle vertical line higher than the rounded sides, is specific for the 6th century Greek inscriptions and the oldest forms of the Greek Uncial script. In this inscription there is a free alternation between \u03b5 and \u03b1\u03b9, \u03b7 and \u03b9, and \u03bf and \u03c9. These groups became homophones in Koine Greek, merging to,  and. Also \u03bf\u03c5 was read, \u03c5 was read, and \u03bf\u03b9 was read either  or. In the late 19th century, J\u00f3zsef Hampel suggested that the treasure of Nagyszentmikl\u00f3s was buried by Gepids in the 4th or 5th century AD, and attempted to decipher the text of the inscription using the Greek language. Three words end in -\u03b3\u03b7, which was read by Hampel as the Greek \u03b3\u1fc6 = \"land, country\". He concluded that the inscription records two Gepid princes, Bouila and Boutaoul, and the three lands they ruled: Tagro, Etzi and Dygetoi. The last toponym was connected with the Getae of the Classical Antiquity. This interpretation was sharply criticized by Vilhelm Thomsen and Gyula N\u00e9meth, who showed that the language of the inscription cannot be Greek, but an old Turkic language. Today almost all scholars share the view that the text was written in a Turkic language, but it has not been deciphered and the exact classification of the language has been a subject of debate. It has been often compared with the Turkic Bulgar language of the First Bulgarian Empire, attested on several 8th-9th century inscriptions found in north-eastern Bulgaria and written in Greek letters. More recently Eugene Helimski argued the language is close to Proto-Tungusic, but this proposal was rejected by Marcel Erdal as far-fetched. It is generally agreed that the first word is the Turkic title buyla or boyla (also spelled boila) which is attested on several Old Turkic and Danube Bulgar inscriptions and also mentioned by some 9th and 10th centuries Byzantine authors. Some scholars proposed that Buyla should be read as a personal name in this text. Butaul is usually read as a personal name. It may be interpreted as \"son of Buta\" with the final -ul being a development of the Turkic o\u011ful = \"son\". This etymology was challenged based on the observation that according to the predominant model of construction of Turkic patronymics, the possessive forms o\u011flu or o\u011fli are expected. Based on the names attested on Old Turkic inscriptions, Erdal posited the reading But Aul. In 1900, Karl Brugmann derived the Common Slavic *\u017eupan\u044a from \u017eupa \"district, small administrative region\", an etymology that was accepted by many linguists. However, others suggested the opposite evolution: \u017eupa as a back formation from \u017eupan, a title of Iranian etymological origin, generally found among Slavs.\n",

Ermengarde was born c. 1170 to, Viscount of Beaumont-le-Vicomte, Fresnay and Ste-Suzanne, and  (died aft. 1217). She married King William I of Scotland at the royal chapel at Woodstock Palace near Oxford in England on 5 September 1186 by Baldwin, Archbishop of Canterbury. The marriage was arranged by King Henry II of England, who was at the time the acknowledged overlord of Scotland: William considered her status beneath him, but agreed after Henry offered to pay for the entire wedding, land valued at 100 merks and 40 knight\u2019s fees, and to return the castles that he had forfeited, one of them being Edinburgh. The chronicler Walter Bower described Ermengarde as \u2018an extraordinary woman, gifted with a charming and witty eloquence\u2019. Though William had many lovers before his marriage, he was reportedly never unfaithful to her after their wedding. The relatives of Ermengarde benefited from her status as queen. She is recorded to have presided with the Bishop of St. Andrews over a complex court case. In 1207, there was a complaint by a canon that a royal chaplain obtained the bishopric of Glasgow by bribing the King and the Queen. Queen Ermengarde is credited with mediating a renegotiation of the 1209 treaty, probably due to her husband\u2019s incapacity. Due to the illness of William, Ermengarde took over some of his duties during his later years, and there is evidence that she wielded considerable influence in public affairs. In 1212, she accompanied William with their children to King John of England to secure the succession of their son Alexander. Ermengarde was described as distraught and lethargic over her husband\u2019s death in 1214. As queen dowager, she devoted her time to the foundation of a Cistercian abbey at Balmerino in Fife. It was completed in 1229, and she often visited it as a guest with her son Alexander. She stayed at the abbey many times. Margaret of Scotland (1193\u20131259).

A native of Virginia, both he and his younger brother Joseph Meek would spend their lives as trappers west of the Rocky Mountains. Stephen Meek was born in Washington County, Virginia, on July 4, 1807. In his autobiography he claims to be a relative of President James K. Polk. He was educated in the local public schools in Virginia before beginning work for William Sublette in 1827. He began working as a laborer for Sublette's Rocky Mountain Fur Company in St. Louis, Missouri. Soon, however, he became a trapper for a variety of companies. Meek joined an expedition with Benjamin Bonneville in 1831 as a trapper, while Bonneville was exploring the Great Salt Lake. From 1833 to 1834 he traveled to California with Joseph R. Walker. Meek moved to Oregon in 1835 and began working at the Hudson's Bay Company's Fort Vancouver for John McLoughlin. This included trips to California with Tom McKay. In 1841, Meek bought the first lot of the Oregon City, Oregon, townsite from John McLoughlin and helped to survey the land. He joined the American mountaineers that year for one year. The following year he served as a guide for a wagon train of pioneers to the Willamette Valley from Fort Laramie, and in 1845 led the ill-fated group that followed him from the Oregon Trail on the Meek Cutoff. That party split from the main party that included Joel Palmer and Sam Barlow at Fort Hall. In May 1845, he married Elizabeth Schoonover at St. Louis, Missouri, with whom he later had one son, George. The Meeks would reside at Linn City, Oregon, until 1848. Meek would later spend time in the mines of the California Gold Rush before settling in Siskiyou County, California. In 1850, he briefly returned to Oregon, before returning to California continuing to mine until 1865. In 1865, Elizabeth died, and he returned to working as a guide and trapper.

        "reference": ", most notably the underachieving elder brother Eric Matthews on the long-running TV sitcom Boy Meets World from 1993 to 2000. More recently, he has voiced a number of animated characters such as Terry McGinnis/Batman, the title character of Batman Beyond, and Ron Stoppable of Kim Possible. He voices Deadpool in Ultimate Spider-Man and Star-Lord in the animated version of Guardians of the Galaxy, replacing Chris Cox. He also performed the voices of Doyle in The Secret Saturdays, Lion-O in the rebooted ThunderCats series, and Blue Beetle on Batman: The Brave and the Bold. He has been the speaking voice of Bumblebee in the final episode of Transformers: Prime and the movie Transformers Prime Beast Hunters: Predacons Rising and in the stand-alone sequel series Transformers: Robots in Disguise, as well as in Transformers: Rescue Bots. Friedle was born in Hartford, Connecticut, the son of Patricia Joan (n\u00e9e Leary) and Gary Allen Friedle, both lawyers. After committing himself to becoming an actor, Friedle continually commuted from Avon, Connecticut to New York City for auditions. He graduated from Avon High School in 1994. Friedle is credited on school brochures as having attended Occidental College. However, when interviewed on the February 11, 2019 episode of Critical Role: Between The Sheets, he admitted having never attended the school. He stated that he learned he was being inaccurately credited by Occidental College as being an alumnus when his nephew visited the school and showed him the information package. Additionally, he stated that he studied Latin for six years because he intended to become an archaeologist eventually. In the July 4, 2006, issue of People, Friedle mentioned he had thought about attending culinary school. After co-hosting Nickelodeon's Don't Just Sit There for three seasons (1988\u20131991), Friedle was cast as Cory Matthews' likeable but underachieving elder brother Eric on the long-running TV sitcom Boy Meets World from 1993 to 2000. In 2004, he co-starred with Chris Owen in the independent film National Lampoon's Gold Diggers (originally titled Lady Killers). He also appeared in a supporting role in the 2005 ABC Family movie Everything You Want. Friedle was cast as Mike in the WB sitcom Off Centre, but could not accept the role because of a previous commitment to the UPN series The Random Years. The role ended up going to Eddie Kaye Thomas. Friedle voiced Seifer Almasy in the English version of the video game Kingdom Hearts II, Gideon Wyeth in the English version of the video game Advent Rising, and Jaster Rogue in the English version of the video game Rogue Galaxy. In December 2013, in spite of initial reluctance, it was announced that Friedle would reprise his Boy Meets World role of Eric Matthews on the continuation series Girl Meets World. In April 2014, it was confirmed that Friedle reprised his Batman Beyond role of Terry McGinnis on the Batman Beyond short made by Darwyn Cooke to commemorate the 75th Anniversary of Batman. In 1997, Friedle dated actress Jennifer Love Hewitt, and co-starred with her in the romantic teen comedy Trojan War. Hewitt made a guest appearance as Jennifer Love \"Feffy\" Fefferman on Boy Meets World episode \"And Then There Was Shawn\". Friedle is best friends with actor Jason Marsden and was the best man at Marsden's wedding in October 2004. The two have also worked together in numerous productions: Boy Meets World, Trojan War, Static Shock, Kim Possible, Batman Beyond, Justice League Unlimited, Batman: The Brave and the Bold, ThunderCats and Mad. He married his girlfriend, Susan Martens, on September 25, 2016, in Connecticut.\n",

In the years between the two world wars a number of factors conspired to hinder the modernization of French artillery such as limited budgets, competing priorities (fortifications, tanks, navy, and aircraft), large stocks of ammunition, large stocks of spare guns and complacency about the effectiveness of existing weaponry. These factors meant that France went into World War II with large numbers of old artillery and modernization efforts mainly focused on converting older guns to use motor traction (sprung suspension and pneumatic tires) instead of horse traction. In the aftermath of World War II, the French Army was equipped with a variety of weaponry. There were French, British, German and US weapons in use. In 1946 DEFA (Direction des \u00c9tudes et Fabrications d'Armement) began a design study to build a new 105 mm howitzer for the French Army to replace its assortment of weapons. It would be the first 105 mm gun designed and built in Western Europe after World War II. The mle 1950 would be a departure from previous designs because it would feature a three outrigger tripod carriage which was more common for anti-aircraft guns than howitzers. For travel, the gun was towed by one rearward facing outrigger which had a towing eye and two outriggers folded forward for the barrel to rest on. The carriage also had a two-wheeled torsion bar suspension and a curved three-piece gun shield for the crew. Once in firing position, the wheels were raised and the outriggers were spread to form a Y.  This allowed a wide range of elevation -7\u00b0 to +70\u00b0 as well as 360\u00b0 traverse similar to the Soviet D30 howitzer. However, unlike the D30 the mle 1950 had a gun shield, its hydro-pneumatic recoil system was mounted below the barrel, it had a double-baffle muzzle brake, and there wasn't a towing eye on the barrel. In addition to its towed version the mle 1950 was the primary armament of the Mk 61 105mm self-propelled howitzer. This consisted of a mle 1950 mounted in a large non-traversing armored casemate on an AMX-13 light tank chassis.\n",

The half-hour long piece is a comic sketch about two (supposedly) blind beggars, consisting of an overture and four numbers. Offenbach was bold in making light of the disabled poor, but he believed that his patrons would see the humour of the piece. Most Parisians had been pestered by beggars on Parisian street corners, and Offenbach's blind beggars were con men, rather than deserving outcasts of society. The little piece was an instant hit, praised for its catchy dance tunes, and it soon spread Offenbach's name and music around the world. Les deux aveugles premiered on the opening night of the Bouffes-Parisiens on 5 July 1855 at the company's first theatre, the tiny Salle Lacaze on the Champs-Elys\u00e9es in Paris. It was the hit of the evening and was performed at the Salle Lacaze into the fall, making stars of the comedians who appeared in it. After Offenbach's new winter theatre, the Salle Choiseul, opened in December, the show continued to be presented there. It had become so successful, that Louis-Napol\u00e9on invited Offenbach's company to perform it for representatives to the Congress of Paris in the Salon de Diane in the Palace of the Tuileries on 28 February 1856. A revised version was presented in Paris at a matinee gala at the Op\u00e9ra-Comique's second Salle Favart on 28 May 1858, with revivals on 6 November 1900, 14 December 1910, and 12 December 1934. The piece was first seen in Berlin at Kroll's on 10 March 1856 and in Vienna at the Carltheater on 19 April, where it played as part of a tour by the French actor Pierre Levassor from the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Palais-Royal. The first work by Offenbach to be presented in Vienna, it strongly influenced the subsequent career of Karl Treumann. On 27 June 1856 Levassor and his partner Jules Lefort gave the first performance in London, a concert version at the Hanover Square Rooms, and it was also part of the opening night of the Bouffes-Parisiens' first London season in 1857, which ran at St James's Theatre from 20 May to 14 July. It was given in Antwerp (in French) on 21 November 1856, New York at the Metropolitan Music Hall on 31 August 1857, Buenos Aires on 13 October 1861, and Saigon, the first opera ever performed there, in the autumn of 1864. Les deux aveugles was translated into German by Carl Friedrich Wittmann as Zwei arme Blinde and was performed in Vienna at the  on 26 May 1863 and in Dresden on 19 November 1866. In English it played at London's Gallery of Illustration as Beggar Thy Neighbour on 29 March 1870, at London's large Gaiety Theatre as A Mere Blind (translated by H. B. Farnie and starring Fred Sullivan) on 15 April 1871, and by Harry Rickards' company at the School of Arts in Sydney, Australia, as The Blind Beggars on 9 September 1873. The Op\u00e9ra de Monte Carlo performed it in French on 7 May 1902, and London's Ambassadors Theatre, on 11 May 1914 (also in French). It had clearly become one of Offenbach's most successful one-act works. Arthur Sullivan saw the piece at the amateur 'Moray Minstrels' group in London and was prompted to collaborate with FC Burnand on the first of his many operettas, Cox and Box (1866). In its use of the voice imitating a musical instrument and the combination together of separate melodies (though done previously by Sullivan), the Offenbach points towards features of the one-act Sullivan piece with which it shared an evening. A complete performance of Les deux aveugles (followed by Croquefer, ou Le dernier des paladins) forms part of the 1996 television film Offenbachs Geheimnis, directed by Istv\u00e1n Szab\u00f3. The work was presented by Palazzetto Bru Zane on a double bill with Le compositeur toqu\u00e9 by Herv\u00e9  at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Marigny, Paris, for a series of performances beginning in January 2019. With Les deux aveugles Offenbach became the darling of Second Empire Paris. His later pieces would continue to mock customs of the day, without really upsetting the status quo enjoyed by the theatre-going public. Offenbach's early operettas were small-scale one-act works, since the law in France limited musical theatre works (at all except the principal theatres) to one-act pieces with no more than three singers and, perhaps, some mute characters. In 1858, this law was changed, and Offenbach was able to offer full-length works, beginning with Orpheus in the Underworld. Two \"blind\" beggars compete for the best position on a bridge, first in a musical battle with Patachon playing on a trombone and Giraffier a mandolin, then in a game of cards, in which they cheat and betray their pretense of blindness. 'Business' has not been brisk. When passers-by drop coins, the beggars are able to see well enough to retrieve them. To impress each other, they fabricate wild stories, accompanied by singing. The contest becomes comically grotesque. The music consists of an overture and four short numbers, of which the bolero, a duet which begins \"La lune brille, le ciel scintille\" (\"The moon beams, the sky sparkles\"), is probably the standout.\n",

Sugar refiners and manufacturers of sugary foods and drinks have also  sought to influence medical research and public health recommendations, The results of research on the health effects of sugary food and drink differ significantly, depending on whether the researcher has financial ties to the food and drink industry. The authors of a 2016 review of funding bias concluded that \"This industry seems to be manipulating contemporary scientific processes to create controversy and advance their business interests at the expense of the public's health\". In the early 1950s, sugar was marketed as a healthy substance that would help curb hunger and provide an energy boost. More recent methods are necessarily less direct. targeting children; below age seven, they have difficulty recognizing persuasive intent, and below the age of twelve, they are more easily distracted from it than adults. Sugar refiners and manufacturers of sugary foods and drinks have sought to influence medical research and public health recommendations, with substantial spending documented from the 1960s to 2016. The results of research on the health effects of sugary food and drink differ significantly, depending on whether the researcher has financial ties to the food and drink industry. The authors of a 2016 review of funding bias concluded that \"This industry seems to be manipulating contemporary scientific processes to create controversy and advance their business interests at the expense of the public's health\". A 2013 review concluded that \"unhealthy commodity industries should have no role in the formation of national or international NCD [non-communicable disease] policy\". There have been similar efforts to steer coverage of sugar-related health information in popular media, including news media and social media. The Sugar Research Foundation, a trade association for the sugar industry, conceived, funded, and participated in an influential 1967 medical review. It was called \"SRF Funds Project 226\", and published as \"Dietary Fats, Carbohydrates and Atherosclerotic Vascular Disease\". While this took place in 1965\u20131967, it was documented in a 2016 JAMA Internal Medicine publication which reviewed industry documents. Among the researchers who put their names to the 1967 review, David Mark Hegsted went on to write national nutrition guidelines, and Fredrick J. Stare was head of Harvard University's nutrition department. Rules surrounding conflicts of interest in academic publishing were laxer then, helping the payment to go undeclared. Taking into account \"other recent analyses of sugar industry documents\", the 2016 review concludes that such actions were part of a wider industry-sponsored research program in the 1960s and 1970s. It also concludes that \"Policymaking committees should consider giving less weight to food industry\u2013funded studies\". Immediately afterwards, the same Sugar Research Foundation funded a study comparing sugar-fed and starch-fed rats. \"SRF Funds Project 259: Dietary Carbohydrate and Blood Lipids in Germ-Free Rats\" was funded from 1967 until 1971, when, after reporting preliminary results to the funders, it did not have its funding renewed. The research was never published. The U.S. National Institute of Dental Research's 1971 National Caries Program was lobbied by the sugar industry, which substantially influenced the types of research the caries program called for. Research on food cariogenicity that could have harmed the sugar industry was omitted from funding priorities. The NIDR's public health task force on caries and an industry task force on caries had almost exactly the same members. The NIDR copied 78% of the industry groups' report into their own, with portions being copied verbatim. After the WHO recommended cutting sugar consumption to less than 10% of daily energy intake in 1990, the International Life Sciences Institute gained accreditation as a research organization the WHO and FAO. The institute was founded by parties including Coca-Cola, PepsiCo and General Foods. Phillip James, head of the International Obesity Taskforce, considered that this accreditation increased industry influence over world health guidelines. The development of official European dietary guidelines was influenced by European sugar industry groups, who in 2000 threatened to block the report if a recommendation to limit sugar consumption to less than 10% of daily energy intake were not removed. The medical experts felt forced change the recommendation, to one that sugar should not be eaten more than four times a day. Industry groups also criticized the evidence behind the World Health Organization 2003 recommended limit on free sugar consumption (again, to less than 10% of daily energy intake). The US sugar industry additionally lobbied the US Congress to cut funding to the WHO. When the WHO updated the recommendations, a decade later in 2013, it commissioned two reviews, and found support for both the earlier recommendation and a new, stricter one, half as high as the old limit. This also met with industry opposition. The WHO began requiring anyone submitting formal comments on the proposal to fill out a conflict-of-interest form. In 2011, the competing Corn Refiners Association (which makes sugar syrups) and the Sugar Association became involved in a lawsuit against one another, which continued as of 2015. In the course of this lawsuit, numerous internal documents were made public. These revealed funding of over $10 million to James Rippe for health research and media outreach, and a combined $4 million to Citizens for Health and Center for Consumer Freedom, which publicly opposed one another's views on the healthiness of the rival products without acknowledging their funding (such shilling is legal in the US following the Citizens United ruling). In 2015, it was reported that Coca-Cola had paid millions to promote controversial health messages related to sweet drinks, ranging from academic research to social media posts, since 2008. The money went to researchers, dietitians, health experts, research organizations, and professional associations, among others. Following this media attention, Coca-Cola released information on almost $120 million U.S. dollars given out to medical, health and community organizations between 2010 and 2015. These include $29 million for academic research; the largest donation was $7. 5 million to Louisiana State University's Pennington Biomedical Research Center. Coca-Cola has now announced that it will \"pull back\" (reporter's phrasing) from funding health experts and obesity research, in order to improve its transparency. A 2016 investigation of PepsiCo and Coca-Cola sponsorship and lobbying found funding going to \"63 public health groups, 19 medical organizations, seven health foundations, five government groups and two food supply groups\", including the National Institutes of Health, the American Diabetes Association, and professional associations of medical specialists. They found evidence that PepsiCo had funded 14% of the organizations, and Coca-Cola had funded 99%. However, the authors suspect this difference is overestimated; Coca-Cola had recently released some funding data (see previous paragraph), while, they say, PepsiCo is \u201cknown for making its sponsorship data extremely difficult to track\u201d. Sugar is added to ingredients lists under dozens of different names, which, where ingredients lists are in order from largest to smallest quantity, can let sugars appear spuriously lower on the ingredients list. In 2016, the FDA enacted new requirements for US nutrition labels, which include calorie count in larger type and a separate line for added sugars. By July 2018 most manufacturers will need to use the new label. The new FDA requirements were initially proposed in 2014, they met with strong opposition from sugar and sugary food producers. Industry claimed the new rule lacked any scientific justification. Many specific companies also wrote letters requesting certain products to be exempt from the rule. The head of Ocean Spray Cranberries wrote a letter to the FDA explaining that cranberries without sugar are \"unpalatable\" and claimed that they needed to be an exception to the bill. The American Beverage Association wanted the measurement on the back of their labels to be in grams instead of teaspoons, saying that teaspoon measurements would carry a negative connotation that misrepresents the factual nature of nutritional information. The changes had bipartisan support; George W. Bush supported the FDA in its request for the legislation, and, after it was enacted under Barack Obama, said that the government had \"got this right\". A community campaign in Howard County, Maryland used the media to influence the attitudes and behaviors about the relationship between sugary drinks and obesity. The \"Howard County Unsweetened\" campaign used social media, television ads, in-person marketing, and community organizations to encourage people to drink less sugary drinks, and promoted water as a substitute. This campaign was modeled after a study done in Portland, Oregon that found community based interventions were successful in influencing consumers likelihood of purchasing sugary drinks in supermarkets. Researchers associated sugary drinks with obesity, heart disease, and diabetes to influence the attitudes of the consumers and the purchasing behaviors of consumers. Sugar taxes have been used to reduce the consumption of sugary drinks, often in combination with public information campaigns. A 2010 study of a sugar taxes in the US found that they decreased consumption of taxed drinks, but increased the consumption of untaxed high-calorie drinks, removing the benefit. In Mexico, sugary drink consumption dropped after a public health campaign including a sugar tax came in in 2014, and dropped further a year later. A 2015 tax in Berkeley, California had a similar effect, although overall grocery spending did not decline. In 2016, the far larger city of Philadelphia brought in a sugar tax to fund children's programs.\n",

        "reference": " student of Louis Althusser and collaborator on the influential volume Reading Capital, Macherey is a central figure in the development of French post-structuralism and Marxism. His work is influential in literary theory and Continental philosophy in Europe (including Britain) though it is generally little read in the United States. Macherey is known for his contribution to Reading Capital, his influential work in Marxist literary criticism, and intensive philosophical engagement with both Spinoza and Hegel. His work on these figures (from his early Hegel or Spinoza through his Hegel et la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 and his five volume study of Spinoza's Ethics) complicates a relationship that is often otherwise taken to be a simple opposition between the competing paradigms of 'immanance' and 'dialectics'. For Macherey, as Jason Read puts it, \"the task is not to choose between Team Hegel and Team Spinoza, but to interrogate each by means of the other\". Since October 2000, he has been engaged in a group project entitled \"La Philosophie au sens large\" (Philosophy in the grand sense), which has been hosted on the academic web platform Hypotheses.org since 2009. The project collects essays, presentations, and longer form studies that highlight the interrelation between philosophy and the literary, political, artistic, and social scientific thought that conditions it. The project is described as an attempt to reformulate the problematic of practice. In this context, Macherey has described philosophy in the 'grand sense' as \" a conjunctural practice, which has no other means of surpassing the limits imposed by the conjunctures with which it is confronted other than to reflect on them and to elucidate their conditions in such a way as to eventually be able to intervene with regard to them and, therefore, to contribute to the transformation or evolution of these conjunctures\".

        "reference": " guitarist started out in Los Angeles in the late 1960s, playing sessions and local live gigs with Kris Kristofferson, as well as future Eagles members, Glenn Frey and Bernie Leadon. Beland's first major break came in 1970, when he played lead guitar for a young Linda Ronstadt. He helped Ronstadt put together her first serious solo band, Swampwater. Along with bandmates Gib Guilbeau, Thad Maxwell and Stan Pratt, Swampwater toured the country with Ronstadt, appearing with her on many notable television shows including The Johnny Cash Show. Swampwater recorded two landmark country-rock albums for Starday-King and RCA Records. The group was one of the first Los Angeles bands to record in Nashville, known for their smooth harmonies and Cajun rock style. After working with Ronstadt, Beland became a much in-demand guitarist, engaged by such high-profile artists as Arlo Guthrie, Johnny Tillotson, Kris Kristofferson, The Bellamy Brothers, Mac Davis, Dolly Parton and The Flying Burrito Brothers. As a solo artist, Beland recorded for Ranwood Records, scoring a chart hit in 1969 called \"Baby You Come Rolling Cross My Mind\". Beland also became the last artist to sign with The Beatles' record company Apple Records in 1973. As a session guitarist, Beland recorded with many music business legends in the United States and internationally. For over twenty years, he was the creative force behind the pioneering country rock band from California, The Flying Burrito Brothers. Through his leadership, the group achieved nine hit country singles for Curb Records in the early 1980s. Beland was also instrumental in the comeback of rock and roll legend Rick Nelson in the late 1970s, arranging and playing on Nelson's last hit single \"Dream Lover\", as well as Nelson's much-acclaimed album The Memphis Sessions. He also toured and appeared with him on Saturday Night Live in 1979. Beland has also received awards from the American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers (ASCAP) during his career. As an award-winning songwriter, Beland's songs have been recorded by a wide variety of recording artists from various genres. They have included artists from pop, folk, gospel to country music. Beland was born and raised in Hometown, Illinois, and was the eldest son of Clarence and Celine Beland. While growing up, he listened to a number of well-known American music artists. This included Buddy Holly, the Everly Brothers and Ricky Nelson. He was inspired by the music from a young age and began to play the guitar, predominantly rock and roll. At six years old, he received a toy Davy Crocket model guitar, but wouldn't own a guitar until he was seventeen. During high school, Beland played with local bands, performing in small venues and at private parties. He practiced on his own at home, while listening to  Dick Biondi on WLS radio. In an interview, Beland recalled the influence The Beatles had on his life as a young musician. He stated that he had never heard music like it and inspired him as a guitarist. Beland became more involved in local music over the coming years as a teenager. He took little interest in school, instead, he focused on practicing blues and jazz tracks that were popular at the time, including Mose Allison, Ramsey Lewis and Bo Diddley. He was also strongly influenced by the Rolling Stones. He formed a small jazz trio in his hometown and regularly played small gigs. They would take pop songs and, as Beland described it, \"jazz them up\". Performing these musical blends further influenced Beland's youth. As his tastes and performances matured, Beland began to have a passion for jazz pianist Vince Guaraldi's music. His biggest inspiration as a teenager was The Byrds. He recalled hearing The Byrds single Mr. Tambourine Man for the first time and being instantly connected and inspired by the Bob Dylan written track. As Beland performed more regularly, his music began to take on The Byrds' sound, showing how they had influenced him as a young musician. Beland's life changed in 1967 when his father secured a new job, meaning the family would be moving to Los Angeles. They took a 3-day train journey from Chicago to California. They ended up living an hour outside Los Angeles, in the town of La Puente. Beland didn't attend his new school in Southern California and instead spent his days sneaking into movie studios and record companies to learn more about passions of filmmaking and music. When his family and the school realized what he was doing on a daily basis, they moved him to a continuation school for troubled teens. Determined to follow his dreams of becoming a musician, Beland recorded a dozen original tracks on a stolen tape recorder. When he was dropped at continuation school the next day, he hitchhiked to Los Angeles in hope of getting a record deal. He lived on the streets for a couple of weeks after leaving home, speaking to publishing companies and record labels on a daily basis and showing them his homemade demo tape. After speaking to a record executive at Capitol Records, he advised Beland to try playing live at a club in Los Angeles called the Troubadour. Every Monday he attended open mic night at the venue and for $1 he would be able to perform for 15 minutes. He became well known by performers and regulars at the club, before host, Larry Murray decided to showcase Beland at the primetime slot in front of numerous record label executives. After performing one night at the Troubadour, he was approached by Lois Dalton, who was a former member of The Back Porch Majority folk group. She had set up their own music production group and she offered to help Beland in any way she could. After weeks of living on the street, Beland was desperate for somewhere to stay. Dalton and her family took him in. Dalton spoke with Beland's parents and it was decided he would stay with the Dalton's in Los Angeles to pursue his music career under her guidance. Beland spent much of his early career living with Dan and Lois Dalton and their family. Under their guidance, he signed a music publishing deal, which allowed him to buy his first ever guitar, a Guild F-50. Dan Dalton began to use Beland on many of their music production group's tracks, which ended up securing Beland a solo record deal. He started on The Glen Campbell Goodtime Hour, playing to the studio audience between set changes at a rate of $250 a week. Englebert Humperdinck recorded one of Beland's tracks, titled Nashville Lady, which secured Beland more income. Around the same time as his The Glen Campbell Goodtime Hour performances, he befriended two struggling singer-songwriters, Glenn Frey and J.D. Souther. Both musicians would play for food and beer as a duo Longbranch Pennywhistle. Beland joined them playing on gigs as they reminded him of the Everly Brothers. He also worked with R.B. Greaves when he was a young struggling songwriter before he had his number 1 single in 1969. Beland's luck changed over the next couple of months as he and Lois Dalton sang the theme song for the popular sitcom and ABC's hit show, The Brady Bunch. He continued to attend Troubadour, where he was introduced to Kris Kristofferson, a musician from Nashville, Tennessee. It was decided that Beland would back up the performer on acoustic guitar for Kristofferson. They performed three tracks, \"Help Me Make It Through the Night\", \"For The Good Times\", and \"Me And Bobby McGee\". According to Beland, all three received a cold reception. In 1969, Beland answered an ad in The Hollywood Reporter calling for lead guitarists who could sing harmony. As an 18-year-old guitarist, he felt he needed the experience. It was for a new group called One Man's Family, which consisted of members of the pop group, Spanky and Our Gang. With the assistance of the Dalton's, Beland decided to take the role after it was offered to him. While he was rehearsing with One Man's Family, Beland started to spend more time with Linda Ronstadt, who knew members of the One Man's Family. She and Beland hit it off and she asked Beland if he would join her new solo band, as she had decided to quit the Stone Poneys who she was playing with at the time. Beland took the decision to stay with One Man's Family, as they had given him the opportunity to perform. He and Ronstadt remained on good terms and she stated that a position in her band would always be open to him. One Man's Family toured across the United States in late 1969, with Beland as their lead guitarist. They opened for groups such as Steppenwolf, The Hollies and The Byrds. At a concert in Chicago, he met Clarence White, where he was fascinated by his Telecaster way of playing. Shortly after the concert, One Man's Family suddenly split after Nigel Pickering quit the band. Beland immediately phoned Linda Ronstadt, who told him she had a guitar gig for him if he wanted it. Beland moved back to Los Angeles and joined Linda Ronstadt's first solo band. With Ronstadt's band, Beland toured the United States, performing at the Capitol Records Convention; Fillmore West with The Byrds; the Big Sur celebration with The Beach Boys and also at Troubadour. At the Troubadour gig, Kris Kristofferson was the opening act. After speaking with Kristofferson, Beland decided to join his band too at $35 for a week run. Kristofferson played the same songs he had played with Beland a year prior, but this time had a much better reception. Beland's connection with the Troubadour remained for a number of years, where he saw debut performances by The Carpenters, Poco and Elton John. He also met a band there called The Flying Burrito Brothers. Ronstadt's bass player was replaced in the early 1970s by Beland's friend and former One Man's Family band member, Thad Maxwell. Shortly after Maxwell joined Linda Ronstadt's band, the backing band started their own band called Swampwater. Their sound was a combination of Guilbeau's hard driving Cajun rock and Beland's Byrds-Beach Boys style harmonies. Shortly after the formation of Swampwater, they were signed by the Nashville-based Starday-King Records and secured an album deal. The group recorded their first album in Albuquerque, New Mexico with John Wagner as the producer. They created a country hit titled \"Take A City Bride\". The track was the first Los Angeles-based band to score a Billboard country hit single. Swampwater became closely connected to The Byrds, due in part to Gib Guilbeau's connection with Clarence White and Gene Parsons, before they joined the legendary group. The close connection to The Byrds gave the band huge exposure to record executives in Los Angeles. Beland subbed in for Clarence White on numerous recordings for The Byrds, due to his similar sound and style when White was unavailable. Swampwater left Starday-King after recording one album and signed with RCA for a new album that would be produced by Larry Murray. Many of the sessions took place in Los Angeles and Nashville. Unfortunately, the production on the second album wasn't as good as Beland had hoped. In later interviews, Beland stated that at this time he had become disillusioned with the direction of the band. Despite the position of Swampwater, Beland continued to play on sessions for other Los Angeles-based artists, such as James Taylor's sister Kate Taylor. He was hired by Arlo Guthrie to play in a house band along with Ry Cooder, Gib Guilbeau and The Flying Burrito Brothers bassist Chris Ethridge, for the Tribute to Woody Guthrie concert at the Hollywood Bowl. The concert received huge public acclaim and the live recording of the concert is in the Library of Congress. Swampwater and Linda Ronstadt parted ways in 1971 to become the new backing band touring the country with singer-songwriter Arlo Guthrie. While in Chicago, they learned a new song written by Steve Goodman during a soundcheck. All the band members were fans of the song and began to play it during their tours. It would go on to become an iconic song titled, the \"City Of New Orleans\". Guthrie and Swampwater also played Carnegie Hall that year, but Beland grew tired of Swampwater's lack of commercial chart progress and quit the band in 1972 to pursue a solo career and concentrate on playing for other acts. Beland became music director and guitarist for the country pop star Johnny Tillotson. Tillotson and Beland traveled the world together, performing throughout the United States, as well as Germany and the United Kingdom. While touring with Tillotson, he was introduced to Tony King, who was the head of Apple Records. He forwarded on a tape of Beland's recordings to Ringo Starr, who approved Beland to be signed as a solo artist to Apple Records. He returned to Los Angeles to work on his new solo album. Beland didn't complete the solo album under Apple Records, due to The Beatles' pending litigation against their manager Alan Klein. He remained focused on the project and eventually finished the solo album in 1973 with Scepter Records. The album was titled, John Edward Beland. Following the release of the album, he continued to tour and record with Johnny Tillotson and remained an in-demand studio guitarist. Kris Kristofferson hired him again in 1973 after working with him numerous times at the Troubadour. Kristofferson by this point was a household name in music. He toured the country with Kristofferson and his wife Rita Coolidge, meaning Beland had to end touring with Tillotson. He became a featured part of Kristofferson's show, as well as playing on their albums, in concerts and television appearances. In 1975, Beland left the band, citing Kristofferson's drinking issues as the main reason. Not long afterward, Beland was hired by emerging singer-songwriter, Kim Carnes. He played on her albums, \"St. Vincent's Court\" and \"Sailing\", as well as backing her on tour as an opening act for the pop star Neil Sedaka, who was enjoying a comeback at the time. Fortuitously, two brothers from Florida, Howard and David Bellamy, arrived in Los Angeles in 1976. They had just scored a massive hit with \"Let Your Love Flow\". New to the local scene, they hired Beland to record with them. He played on their records and helped them form their first touring band. Later that year, The Bellamy Brothers, with Beland leading the band, joined Loggins and Messina on tour. The Bellamys' follow-up single, \"Crossfire\", was a huge hit in Europe, featuring Beland's signature big electric guitar sound that actually inspired Bonnie Tyler's record, \"It's A Heartache\". Unfortunately, \"Crossfire\" failed to sustain The Bellamys, and after a major equipment robbery in Chicago, Beland left the act. Mac Davis then hired Beland in 1977. He toured the country with Davis, primarily working Las Vegas, but lost interest in Davis' slick cabaret-style show. While on tour in New England, Beland became close friends with Davis' opening act, the powerfully talented Dolly Parton. Beland and Parton became fast friends. Soon after returning to Los Angeles, he parted ways with Davis and became Parton's guitarist. Her new single \"Here You Come Again\" was released that year, and her career skyrocketed. Beland then began to tour with Parton throughout the United States. During the Parton tour, Beland got a call from Greg McDonald, the manager of Ricky Nelson. McDonald explained that Nelson was planning to get back to his rock and roll roots by putting together a great band that matched the caliber of his early TV days. Beland's reputation as a James Burton-style player made him Nelson's choice for the new lead guitarist. The new band would make its debut with Nelson in Las Vegas. Sweet Inspirations, the same group that backed Elvis Presley in his Vegas appearances, provided the vocal back-up for Nelson. As a big fan of Nelson, Beland knew his hits up and down. Nelson worked up many of his old hits that he hadn't played for years, mostly because past members and producers had told him how dated they were. On days off with Parton, Beland played gigs with Nelson. Beland had cut his teeth on Nelson's hits and was his biggest fan. He knew all the classic guitar solos left to right, just like on the records, and his style was reminiscent of Nelson's original guitarist, James Burton. Touring with Dolly Parton and playing with Nelson at the same time became wearing for Beland. The meteoric rise in her popularity brought on a huge entourage of management, agents, band members, and politics. The intimate relationship he once shared with her had dwindled, and he felt that it was time to move on. Parton discussed it with him; she noticed how excited he seemed to be working with Ricky Nelson. With her blessing, Beland turned in his notice to Parton and became Rick Nelson's full-time guitarist. Beland played on Nelson's latest recording project produced by Al Kooper, but from the start, he felt that the material was shoddy and far removed from Nelson's true style. The sessions at Sunset Sound were disorganized and disappointing. Kooper did his best, but in the end, the entire album was scrapped. Beland then received a call from McDonald about going to Memphis, Tennessee alone with Nelson and recording an album that captured his country rock style mixes with his love for old rock and roll. This would be Nelson's first time recording away from Los Angeles, and it would just be he and Beland traveling there with a local house rhythm section waiting for them. Larry Rogers produced the sessions at his 16-track studio in a rough part of Memphis. Like Beland, Rogers was a Nelson fan, and the team hit it off like old friends. Beland arranged most of the material and co-wrote one of the songs with Nelson the night before the session, called \"That Ain't The Way Love's Supposed To Be\". Beland also came up with a new arrangement for an old Bobby Darin song, called \"Dream Lover\". The track started as a fast-driving teen anthem before Beland slowed it down to have a James Taylor feel, reminiscent of Nelson's old version of Bob Dylan's \"She Belongs To Me\". \"Dream Lover\" sounded like a smash hit and was planned for release as a single to coincide with Nelson's hosting of the top TV show in the country, Saturday Night Live. At the time of working with Ricky Nelson, Beland received an offer to work with the legendary band, The Flying Burrito Brothers. At first, Beland passed on the opportunity as he felt they had lost their way and had no record deal. However, after discussions with his publisher Bo Golsen at Atlantic Records, Beland decided to join the band, providing he could produce and write for the group. The band agreed, so Beland reluctantly said goodbye to Nelson. Bobby Neil would take over his guitar spot, continuing until both of their deaths in that fateful 1985 plane crash. Beland took the members of The Flying Burrito Brothers into the 16-track studio at Atlantic Records, where they demoed a number of country style songs Beland had written along with fellow Burrito member Gib Guilbeau, his old bandmate from Swampwater. The demos were highly commercial, so Bo Golsen immediately took them to Curb Records' A&R head Dick Whitehouse, who offered the group a deal, under one condition: The label wanted one of their own to produce the band. Beland wouldn't hear of it and threatened to quit. But Golsen reminded him of the opportunity ahead if he played along. Beland agreed reluctantly to the deal and soon producer Michael Lloyd was assigned to the band. Although Beland and Lloyd got along together in the studio, Beland hated the idea of having to turn over the reins to another producer, especially one he didn't want in the first place. Lloyd had produced acts like The Osmonds and The Bellamy Brothers, and although he had success with them, Beland felt his production work was too lightweight for a band like The Flying Burrito Brothers. Despite Beland's objections related to producing, The Burrito Brothers (who had now dropped \"Flying\") went on to score major country hits, a first in their ten-year prior history. Certain band members objected to the new country direction, and as a result was fired. The act became a duo. Beland also objected to using any part of The Burrito Brothers' name and suggested that he and Gib Guilbeau change it completely, but the record label refused. Although he and Guilbeau's history was just as extensive as any past members of The Flying Burrito Brothers, critics still chastised them for using the name. Despite the critics, Beland and Guilbeau went on to score hit after hit in years to come, songs like \"She Belongs To Everyone But Me\", \"Closer To You\", \"I'm Drinking Canada Dry\", \"Does She Wish She Was Single Again\" and others, many penned by Beland and Guilbeau. The Burrito Brothers were now a hit country act for Curb/CBS, touring the world and appearing on TV throughout the country. They also performed at the International Country Music Festival in London's Wembley Stadium with Waylon Jennings, The Bellamy Brothers, George Jones, Jerry Lee Lewis, and Tammy Wynette. In 1981, they received the Billboard number-one music award for making the transition from pop to country music. They also received Record World Magazines award for \"Best New Vocal Group of 1981\". A year later, they spearheaded a campaign which helped get their idol, the late country music legend Lefty Frizzell, induced into the Country Music Hall of Fame. That same year, both Beland and Guilbeau moved from California to Nashville to become a true part of the country music industry. Beland went right to work doing sessions, while Guilbeau concentrated on songwriting. Through it all, problems with Curb Records persisted. A third album produced by Randy Scruggs was shelved, even though it yielded two hits, \"Blue and Broken Hearted Me\" and \"Would You Love Me One More Time\". Beland lobbied for a producing role but continued to be ignored by the label. In 1983, they were teamed with producer Brent Maher, who produced The Judds. Beland approved this development, as the two had worked together on his solo album in 1972 when Maher was an engineer at Las Vegas Sound. Now Maher was a hot producer, and he and Beland worked well together. The single they did was an old John Fogerty song called, \"It's Almost Saturday Night\". Both Beland and Guilbeau were excited about this recording because it was reminiscent of their days with Swampwater. It had the big sound of Guilbeau's fiddle, matched with Beland's big Telecaster. The single was a hit, but then Curb fired Mayer over a financial dispute, and the duo was back to no producer. Beland and Guilbeau, as The Burrito Brothers, toured the world in the early to mid-1980s, performing in France, Italy, Spain, Germany, Switzerland, Austria, the Netherlands, Norway, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and the United Kingdom, as well as throughout the United States. Finally, in the mid-1980s, Beland and Guilbeau called it quits due to creative differences. They made their last appearance together as The Burrito Brothers on \"Nashville Now\" to a standing ovation from the studio audience. Through the latter part of the 1980s, Beland remained in Nashville. He wrote the number two Gospel Record of the Year for former Grand Funk Railroad lead singer Mark Farner, called \"Isn't It Amazing\". Beland also hit the road playing guitar for pop singer Nicolette Larson and toured the world many times playing guitar for country music legend, Bobby Bare. In 1990, Beland received a call from David and Howard Bellamy, asking if he would be interested in playing guitar for them again. By now, The Bellamy Brothers were a household name, having scored more country hits than any duo in history. At first, he turned them down, not wanting to tour behind any more artists, in order to concentrate on his writing and session work. But The Bellamys were persistent. Beland joined them, hoping to write with the act, that was now selling millions of records worldwide. Beland immediately went to work playing on their albums, starting with \"She Don't Know That She's Perfect\" and \"Can I Come On Home To You\". Beland toured the world with the Bellamy Brothers, performing three or four times a year in Europe, where the act was huge. The Bellamys also performed nonstop throughout the United States. In 1992, Beland finally co-wrote with David Bellamy, yielding the huge hit single, \"Cowboy Beat\". He and Howard Bellamy also co-wrote their follow-up hit, \"Hard Way To Make An Easy Living\". Beland received an ASCAP Award for his co-writing of \"Cowboy Beat\" in 1993. Ultimately, the heavy touring schedule proved to be too much for Beland. He said goodbye to the Bellamy Brothers in 1993. Meanwhile, The Flying Burrito Brothers reunited in the mid-1990s. Beland took control and produced the band's three critically acclaimed studio albums, Eye of a Hurricane (1994), California Jukebox (1997), and Sons of the Golden West (1999). During the recordings, Beland produced guest performances with Merle Haggard, Waylon Jennings, Ricky Skaggs, Buck Owens, The Oakridge Boys and Charlie Louvin. Beland and The Flying Burrito Brothers toured Europe at the end of the 1990s, performing throughout Germany, Spain, and Switzerland, before finally calling it quits in 2000. In 1999, Beland and his family moved to Napa, California, where he concentrated on producing radio jingles and musical acts in Australia and Germany. In 2002, he received a call from actor and songwriter Billy Bob Thornton, who asked Beland if he'd be interested in recording and touring with him. Beland rehearsed in Beverly Hills with Thornton but eventually passed on touring with him, opting to go instead to Australia to record, produce and perform. In 2003, Beland toured solo through Great Britain and Ireland before returning to the United States and settling near Austin, Texas. There he produced a number of Texas country acts. Beland also traveled to Norway to produce country acts and perform as a solo artist at festivals and clubs. He built up a strong following throughout Norway and continued to perform there quite often through the years. In recent years, Beland continues to produce artists and perform solo. When not recording or performing, he is hard at work on his upcoming, long-awaited biography, Best Seat in the House, as well as hosting his own radio talk show of the same name, featuring guests such as Dolly Parton and other major names he has played behind over his 40-plus year career.\n",

He was promoted to Director in 1854, but continued to produce many large oil paintings, mostly on religious subjects. Arguably, however, his best work involved a series of large glass paintings for stained-glass windows; six for the Stiftskirche, three for the chapel in the Old Castle and one each for the Leonhardskirche, the Greek Chapel in the New Castle and the Johanneskirche. In 1852, he was awarded the Knight's Cross, First Class of the Order of the Crown (W\u00fcrttemberg), which conferred a title of nobility.

Dhalla has sought to block the film's DVD release, arguing that her image was \"doctored\" in its promotional material. The film was created by Sihra Productions, which was principally operated by Nand Sihra with his sons Gee and Chico. This was their second film, after and Indian production called Tera Mera Pyar (My And Your Love). The plot of Kyon? Kis Liye? was loosely based on the real-life murder trial of Hamilton resident Sukhwinder Dhillon, with the Sihra brothers playing lead roles. In Bollywood style, the film featured several musical production numbers shot in and around Hamilton. It was screened in Toronto and Hamilton before being released to theatres in India. Ruby Dhalla appeared in the film as a police officer, and was featured prominently on the film's promotional poster. She explained at the time of the film's release that her image had been digitally altered. \"They've contoured my body a bit,\" she said. \"In India, thin is not as in\". In late 2003, federal Heritage Minister Sheila Copps and Indian High Commissioner Shashi Tripathi signed a letter of intent to create a formal relationship between Bollywood and Canada's South Asian film industry. The ceremony took place at the Sihra family's converted auto shop, and the local media noted that the arrangement would benefit companies such as Sinha productions. Dhalla attempted to block the DVD release of Kyon? Kis Liye? in 2009, arguing that publicity photos and posters from the movie had been \"doctored\" by putting her face on someone else's body. She also said that the film's release was intended to exploit her status as an elected official. Chico Sihra has said that the images were not doctored, and that Dhalla signed a distribution waiver at the time of the film's production. He adds the form was later destroyed in a fire; Dhalla has denied signing a waiver.\n",

After Simon had married into the owner family of Warenhaus Ury Gebr\u00fcder in Leipzig, the two brothers enlarged the business to a chain by establishing a second department store in Zwickau. In 1930, the company (named I. Schocken Sons since 1907) had become the fourth largest department store company in Germany with 20 stores. After the death of Simon Schocken in a car crash in 1929, his brother was sole owner. The most famous stores are the ones in Nuremberg (Aufse\u00dfplatz) (built 1925/26, demolished), Stuttgart (\u2192 Schocken Stuttgart, 1926\u201328, demolished 1960) and Chemnitz (1927\u201330) designed by  architect Erich Mendelsohn. All three can be seen as milestones in modern architecture. After the rise of Nazism, Salman Schocken was politically forced to sell his department stores to the Merkur AG (so-called \"Aryanisation\"). After the war, Schocken sold his regained share of the company (51%) to Helmut Horten GmbH, which later became part of Kaufhof and is currently owned by Metro. Salman Schocken founded his own publishing house (later Schocken Books) in 1931, which later moved to Palestine and the United States. The Schocken family lives in Israel and the United States. Schocken Books is now affiliated with Random House Publishing. The family still owns 60% of the Israeli newspaper Haaretz owned by Salman Schocken.\n",

The Presidential Range is notorious for having some of the worst weather on Earth, mainly because of the unpredictability of high wind speeds and whiteout conditions on the higher summits. Because of the poor weather conditions, the Presidential Range is often used for mountaineering training for those who go on to climb some of the world's highest mountains, including K2 and Everest. Mount Washington, long home of the highest winds recorded on the surface of the Earth at, is the tallest at, followed by neighboring peaks Mount Adams at  and Mount Jefferson at. The range is almost entirely in Coos County. The highest mountains in the Presidential Range are named principally for U.S. presidents, with the tallest mountain (Mount Washington) named for the first president, the second tallest (Mount Adams) for the second president, and so on. However, due to a surveying error, Mount Monroe is actually  taller than Mount Madison, which is not the correct order of presidents. Mount Pierce* \u2014 after Franklin Pierce (formerly Mt. Mount Adams has four subsidiary peaks besides its summit that are also commonly recognized by name. Two are listed above (Sam Adams and John Quincy Adams). The summits marked with an asterisk (*) are included on the peak bagging list of 4,000-foot and higher mountains in New Hampshire; the others are excluded, in some cases because of lesser height and in others because of more technical criteria. Aside from the notable summits, the Presidential Range contains a number of additional named peaks. Several of these peaks, drained on their west faces by the Dry River, are less accessible than the main and most-visited ridge of the range. Mt. The summits marked with an asterisk (*) are included on the peak-bagging list of 4,000-foot and higher mountains in New Hampshire; the others are excluded, in some cases because of lesser height and in others because of more technical criteria. The Presidentials separate drainage via the Saco and Androscoggin rivers into the Atlantic Ocean on the coast of Maine, from drainage into the Israel and Ammonoosuc rivers, thence into the Connecticut River, and thence into Long Island Sound. The so-called Presidential Traverse is a hike that traverses each major summit along the  of the Presidential ridge. The traverse encompasses over  in elevation gain. It can be done in a single day in summer, but during winter it is generally a two- to four-day venture. The traverse is considered strenuous. The range is notorious for its unpredictable and inclement weather, with some of the deadliest mountains in the continental United States. Due to its unique location relative to other geographic features, it holds the world record for highest recorded surface wind speed not within a tropical cyclone. Fatalities in this area are dominated by those that occur on Mount Washington, the highest peak in the range. The New Hampshire Fish and Game Department conducts an average of 200 rescues a year for hikers in need of assistance.\n",

        "reference": " was named for New Westminster, British Columbia. Flower-class corvettes like New Westminster serving with the Royal Canadian Navy during the Second World War were different from earlier and more traditional sail-driven corvettes. The \"corvette\" designation was created by the French as a class of small warships; the Royal Navy borrowed the term for a period but discontinued its use in 1877. During the hurried preparations for war in the late 1930s, Winston Churchill reactivated the corvette class, needing a name for smaller ships used in an escort capacity, in this case based on a whaling ship design. The generic name \"flower\" was used to designate the class of these ships, which \u2013 in the Royal Navy \u2013 were named after flowering plants. Corvettes commissioned by the Royal Canadian Navy during the Second World War were named after communities for the most part, to better represent the people who took part in building them. This idea was put forth by Admiral Percy W. Nelles. Sponsors were commonly associated with the community for which the ship was named. Royal Navy corvettes were designed as open sea escorts, while Canadian corvettes were developed for coastal auxiliary roles which was exemplified by their minesweeping gear. Eventually the Canadian corvettes would be modified to allow them to perform better on the open seas. New Westminster was ordered as part of the 1940\u20131941 Flower-class building program. She was identical to the 1939\u20131940 program except for a few changes. The 1940\u201341 program had water-tube boilers, which were less responsive but had more reliability in providing a consistent supply of steam. The second significant change was that no minesweeping gear was ever installed, as the role of the corvette had changed from coastal auxiliary to convoy escort. New Westminster was laid down 4 February 1941 by Victoria Machinery Depot Co. Ltd. at Victoria, British Columbia and launched 14 May 1941. She was commissioned 31 January 1942 at Victoria. During her career, New Westminster had two major refits. The first significant overhaul took place at Sydney, Nova Scotia from May 1943 until 10 December 1943. During this refit she had her fo'c'sle extended. Her second major refit took place at Saint John from January to March 1945. New Westminster was assigned to Esquimalt Force on the west coast after workups. However, later that year she was reassigned to the east coast to replace corvettes departing for Operation Torch, the invasion of North Africa. She arrived at Halifax 13 October 1942 and was assigned to the Western Local Escort Force (WLEF). With the WLEF, New Westminster escorted convoys on what became known as the \"Triangle Run\", the route between New York City, Boston and St. John's. She remained with that force until departing for her first major refit in May 1943. After returning from workups, New Westminster was assigned to the Mid-Ocean Escort Force, the escort force that protected the Trans-Atlantic convoys. She joined escort group C-5 and in July 1944, alongside them, escorted the largest convoy of the war, HX 300. She departed for another refit at the end of the year. When she returned to service in April 1945, she was assigned to Sydney Force until the end of the war. Upon cessation of hostilities, New Westminster was paid off at Sorel, Quebec 21 June 1945. She was transferred to the War Assets Corporation who sold her for mercantile conversion in 1947. In 1950 she reappeared as the merchant ship Elisa of. In 1952 she was renamed the Portoviejo and Azura in 1954. She remained under that name until she was sold in 1966 to be stripped at Tampa, Florida before being broken up at Tampico, Florida.\n",

After a one-year loan at Palmeiras' under-20 side, he was promoted to the first team in 2015. Yuri made his professional debut on 9 April 2015, starting in a 2\u20131 Campeonato Paulista away win against Bragantino. A day later, he was loaned to Audax Rio de Janeiro, a club which had the same ownership. Returning to his parent club, Yuri was made a starter by Fernando Diniz during the 2016 campaign, as Audax reached the finals of Paulist\u00e3o for the first time in their history. He contributed with 13 appearances during the tournament, as his side finished second. On 13 May 2016, Yuri was involved in a negotiation with Santos, being linked to a loan move to the club. He would only sign his 18-month loan deal on 7 June, after renewing with Audax until 2020. Yuri made his S\u00e9rie A debut on 15 June 2016, coming on as a late substitute for Caju in a 2\u20130 home win against Sport Recife. On 3 July he scored his first professional goal, netting the third in a 3\u20130 home win against Chapecoense. Yuri started the 2017 campaign as a centre back, mainly as a cover to the absences of Gustavo Henrique, Luiz Felipe and David Braz, all injured. On 27 March of that year, Santos activated the buyout clause of R$ 800,000 on his contract and signed him permanently. His new contract will start after the expiration of the loan deal. Yuri made his Copa Libertadores debut on 19 April 2017, coming on as a late substitute for Bruno Henrique in a 0\u20130 away draw against Independiente Santa Fe. He spent the rest of the campaign as a backup to Alison, Renato and new signing Matheus Jesus. On 14 January 2018, Yuri extended his contract with Santos until December 2020, after cutting ties with Audax. However, he was rarely used by managers Jair Ventura and Cuca during the campaign. On 8 May 2019, despite featuring more regularly under new manager Jorge Sampaoli, Yuri was loaned to fellow first division side Fluminense, until December. On 30 December, his agent confirmed a permanent three-year deal with Flu. Yuri's twin brother Yan is also a footballer. Also a midfielder, he too was groomed at Audax.\n",

        "prefix": "Yahoo! Search is a web search engine owned by Yahoo, headquartered in Sunnyvale, California., it is the fourth largest search engine worldwide across all platforms",
        "reference": " with 2. 32% market share. Originally, \"Yahoo Search\" referred to a Yahoo-provided interface that sent queries to a searchable index of pages supplemented with its directory of websites. The results were presented to the user under the Yahoo! brand. Originally, none of the actual web crawling and data housing was done by Yahoo! itself. In 2001, the searchable index was powered by Inktomi and later was powered by Google until 2004, when Yahoo! Search became independent. On July 29, 2009, Microsoft and Yahoo! announced a deal in which Bing would henceforth power Yahoo! Search. As of July 2018, Microsoft Sites handled 24. 2 percent of all search queries in the United States. During the same period of time, Oath (the then owner of the Yahoo brand) had a search market share of 11. 5 percent. Market leader Google generated 63. 2 percent of all core search queries in the United States. Yahoo! Search has been criticized for favoring websites owned by Yahoo!'s parent company, Verizon Media, in its search results. The roots of Search date back to Yahoo! Directory, which was launched in 1994 by Jerry Yang and David Filo, then students at Stanford University. In 1995, they introduced a search engine function, called Yahoo! Search, that allowed users to search Yahoo! Directory. it was the first popular search engine on the Web, despite not being a true Web crawler search engine. They later licensed Web search engines from other companies. Seeking to provide its own Web search engine results, Yahoo! acquired their own Web search technology. In 2002, they bought Inktomi, a \"behind the scenes\" or OEM search engine provider, whose results are shown on other companies' websites and powered Yahoo! in its earlier days. In 2003, they purchased Overture Services, Inc., which included their owned the AlltheWeb and AltaVista search engines. Initially, even though Yahoo! owned multiple search engines, they didn't use them on the main yahoo.com website, but kept using Google's search engine for its results. Starting on April 7, 2003, Yahoo! Search became its own web crawler-based search engine. They combined the capabilities of search engine companies they had acquired and their prior research into a reinvented crawler called Yahoo! The new search engine results were included in all of Yahoo's websites that had a web search function. Yahoo! also started to sell the search engine results to other companies, to show on their own websites. Their relationship with Google was terminated at that time, with the former partners becoming each other's main competitors. In October 2007, Yahoo! Search was updated with a more modern appearance in line with the redesigned Yahoo! home page. In addition, Search Assist was added; which provides real-time query suggestions and related concepts as they are typed. In July 2008, Yahoo! Search announced the introduction of a new service called  Yahoo! Search BOSS (\"Build your Own Search Engine\"). This service opens the doors for developers to use Yahoo!'s system for indexing information and images and create their own custom search engine. In January 2010, Microsoft announced a deal in which it would take over the functional operation of Yahoo! Search, and set up a joint venture to sell advertising on both Yahoo! Search and Bing known as the Microsoft Search Alliance. A complete transition of all Yahoo! sponsored ad clients to Microsoft adCenter (now Bing Ads) occurred in October 2010. On March 12, 2014, Yahoo announced a partnership with Yelp to integrate its reviews and user-contributed photos into Yahoo! Search (as Bing had previously done). In November 2014, Mozilla signed a five-year partnership with Yahoo, making Yahoo Search the default search engine for Firefox browsers in the US. In April 2015, the Microsoft partnership was modified, now only requiring Bing results on the \"majority\" of desktop traffic, opening the ability for Yahoo to enter into non-exclusive deals for search services on mobile platforms and the remainder of desktop traffic. The amendment also gives either company the ability to terminate the contract with four months' notice. In October 2015, Yahoo subsequently reached an agreement with Google to provide services to Yahoo Search through the end of 2018, including advertising, search, and image search services. As of October 2019, Yahoo! Search is once again \u201cpowered by Bing\u201d. The team at Yahoo Search frequently blogged about search announcements, features, updates and enhancements. The Yahoo Search Blog, as stated provided A look inside the world of search from the people at Yahoo. This included index updates named Weather Updates and their Yahoo Search Assist feature. Yahoo Search also provided their search interface in at least 38 international markets and a variety of available languages. Yahoo! has a presence in Europe, Asia and across the Emerging Markets. Yahoo Search indexed and cached the common HTML page formats, as well as several of the more popular file-types, such as PDF, Excel spreadsheets, PowerPoint, Word documents, RSS/XML and plain text files. For some of these supported file-types, Yahoo Search provided cached links on their search results allowing for viewing of these file-types in standard HTML. Using the Advanced Search interface or Preferences settings, Yahoo Search allowed the customization of search results and enabling of certain settings such as: SafeSearch, Language Selection, Number of results, Domain restrictions, etc. For a Basic and starter guide to Yahoo Search, they also provided a Search Basics tutorial. In 2005, Yahoo began to provide links to previous versions of pages archived on the Wayback Machine. In the first week of May 2008, Yahoo launched a new search mash up called Yahoo Glue, which is in beta testing. On June 20, 2007, Yahoo introduced a selection-based search feature called Yahoo Shortcuts. When activated this selection-based search feature enabled users to invoke search using only their mouse and receive search suggestions in floating windows while remaining on Yahoo properties such as Yahoo Mail. This feature was only active on Yahoo web pages or pages within the Yahoo Publisher Network. Yahoo Shortcuts required the content-owner to modify the underlying HTML of his or her webpage to call out the specific keywords to be enhanced. The technology for context-aware selection-based search on Yahoo pages was first developed by Reiner Kraft. On May 11, 2008, Yahoo introduced SearchScan. If enabled this add-on/feature enhanced Yahoo Search by automatically alerting users of viruses, spyware and spam websites. Yahoo Search provided the ability to search across numerous vertical properties outside just the Web at large. These included Images, Videos, Local, Shopping, Yahoo! Answers, Audio, Directory, Jobs, News, Mobile, Travel and various other services as listed on their About Yahoo Search page.\n",

Mount Saint Macrina, named for Saint Basil's sister, Saint Macrina, was formally dedicated in 1934. Once named Oak Hill, it was the estate (more than 1,000 acres) of coal baron J.V. Thompson (Josiah Van Kirk Thompson), a leading figure in the great coal and coke boom of the late 19th century. Financial misfortune forced him into bankruptcy, and in 1933 the Byzantine Catholic Order of Sisters of St. Basil acquired the property. The Thompson mansion, visible from U.S. Route 40, is now the Sisters' retreat center. The monastery for the community of sisters is a five-story yellow brick building at the north end of the property. An international Order, other groups of the Sisters of St. Basil are spread throughout the world. The newest building on the property is Mount Macrina Manor Nursing Home, dedicated in 1971. Today, the Thompson Mansion serves as a retreat center.

        "prefix": "A strand jack (also known as strandjack) is a jack used to lift very heavy (e.g. thousands of tons or more with multiple jacks",
        "reference": ") loads for construction and engineering purposes. Strandjacking was invented by VSL Australia's Patrick Kilkeary & Bruce Ramsay in 1969 for concrete post tensioning systems, and is now widely used for heavy lifting, to erect bridges, offshore structures, refineries, power stations, major buildings and other structures where the use of conventional cranes is either impractical or too expensive. Strand jacks can be used horizontally for pulling objects and structures, and are widely used in the oil and gas industry for skidded loadouts. Oil rigs of 38,000 t have been moved in this way from the place of construction on to a barge. Since multiple jacks can be operated simultaneously by hydraulic controllers, they can be used in tandem to lift very large loads of thousands of tons. Even the tandem use of two cranes is a very difficult operation. A strand jack is a hollow hydraulic cylinder with a set of steel cables (the \"strands\") passing through the open centre, each one passing through two clamps - one mounted to either end of the cylinder. The jack operates in the manner of a caterpillar's walk: climbing (or descending) along the strands by releasing the clamp at one end, expanding the cylinder, clamping there, releasing the trailing end, contracting, and clamping the trailing end before starting over again. The real significance of this device lies in the facility for precision control. The expansion and contraction can be done at any speed, and paused at any location. Although a jack may lift only 1700 tons or so, there exist computer control systems that can operate 120 jacks simultaneously, offering fingertip feel movement control over extremely massive objects. Strand jacking is a construction process whereby large pre-fabricated building sections are carefully lifted and precisely placed. The alternative would be to do all assembly in situ, even if expensive, technically risky, or dangerous. Strand jacks for heavy lifting and skidding operations are owned and operated by a large number of construction and heavy lifting companies around the world. They are currently manufactured by a small number of companies based in Europe. Costa Concordia disaster, in the ship salvage phase.\n",

        "reference": " created in 1995 jointly between the University of Southampton and the UK Natural Environment Research Council and is located within the port of Southampton at a purpose-built dockside campus with modern facilities. In 2010 the University and NERC components demerged, and the NERC-managed component became the National Oceanography Centre (NOC \u2013 with the Proudman Oceanographic Laboratory in Liverpool). The two components of NOCS continue close collaboration through the jointly run Graduate School, shared research facilities and laboratories, complementary research groups, and many joint research grants and publications. The University component \u201cOcean and Earth Science, National Oceanography Centre Southampton\u201d (OES) is part of the Faculty of Natural and Environmental Sciences, (FNES). It was ranked 30th in the world for Earth and Marine Sciences by the QS World University Rankings in 2014. The centre can trace its origins back to the years immediately after Second World War, when the National Institute of Oceanography (NIO) was founded. The plan to create National Oceanography Centre Southampton as a centre of excellence in marine and earth science was formulated in the late 1980s to early 1990s by the Natural Environment Research Council in coordination with the University of Southampton. According to that plan a research and teaching complex was erected on the new Waterfront Campus dock-side location within the Port of Southampton to become the new home for the former National Institute of Oceanographic Science (from Wormley, Surrey), the Research Vessel Service (from Barry, Wales) and the former University of Southampton departments of Geology and Oceanography. NOCS was officially opened in 1996 as the Southampton Oceanography Centre by Prince Philip (he also renamed it the National Oceanography Centre, Southampton, in 2005). The Centre's inaugural director from 1994-99 was John Shepherd, a former Deputy Director of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and an Earth system scientist. NOCS's on-site resources include the National Marine Facilities, UK National Oceanographic Library, the Discovery Collections, a branch of the British Oceanographic Data Centre and the British Ocean Sediment Core Repository. The National Oceanographic Library holds the UK's most extensive collection of oceanographic literature and one of the largest marine science libraries in Europe. OES was ranked 30th in the world for Earth and Marine Sciences in 2014 by the QS World University Rankings, rising from 47th in 2012 and 38th in 2013. NOCS consists of the University of Southampton\u2019s OES academic unit, together with five NERC research divisions and the NERC's National Marine Facilities Sea Systems. In addition, NOCS houses teaching facilities for nearly 1000 students (undergraduate, Master and PhD). NOCS is the base for the purpose-built research vessels  and  (and formerly RRS Charles Darwin). For fieldwork and research by university staff and students OES operates three smaller vessels, including the  catamaran  and the  RV Bill Conway. NOCS is home to the Marine Autonomous and Robotic Systems group; part of National Marine Facilities Sea Systems, which has the mission to \"develop, coordinate and provide capabilities, platforms and expertise to meet the needs of UK marine science\". The group operates three fleets of submersibles and autonomous vehicles, comprising Autosub submarines, underwater gliders and remotely operated vehicles. NOCS has multi-use aquarium facilities with a variety of tanks displaying a range of biotopes and habitats, including seagrass beds, rocky shores and rock pool environments. Additionally, NOCS is operating two IPOCAMPs and a number of smaller pressurized tanks for the study of deep-sea organisms. The NOCS Coral Reef Laboratory at NOCS is equipped with a multi-compartment aquarium system that houses a range of corals and other cnidarians. NOCS has a variety of large and small analytical instrumentation. The Magnetism Laboratory is equipped with a MicroMag 3900 Vibrating Sample Magnetometer, an AGICO KLY4S Kappabridge and a 2G Superconducting Rock Magnetometer. The X-Ray Diffraction facility is equipped with a X\u2019Pert pro XRD machine with Cu X-ray tube. For geochemical analysis NOCS houses a range of large analytical instrumentation, including two Thermo NEPTUNE multi collector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometers (MC-ICP-MS), a Thermo X-SERIES 2 Quadrupole ICP-MS, a Thermo ELEMENT 2XR high-resolution ICP-MS, a Thermo TRITON and a VG Sector 54 Thermal Ionization system, a New Wave NWR193 laser ablation system. For analysis of dissolved organic carbon and total dissolved nitrogen the Southampton-based branch of the NERC NOC is operating a Shimandzu TOV V CPN-TN at NOCS. For seismic studies of the seafloor, sediment packages and sub-seafloor structures the Marine Geophysics group at NOCS operates a wide range of instrumentation, including Chirp, Boomer, Sparker and 3D Chirp sources, single- and multi-channel hydrophones, several multibeam systems and a sidescan sonar. The Ocean Bottom Instrumentation Consortium based at NOCS provides the academic and commercial communities with access to a range of multi-sensor seabed instruments. The British Ocean Sediment Core Repository (BOSCORF) located at NOCS and operated by NERC is the central storage facility for sediment cores collected by NERC ships and NERC-funded research. All cores are logged and all data generated from the cores is archived for visualization and open access. Three tracks of undergraduate education are offered at the NOCS: a three-year Bachelor of Science, a four-year Integrated Master of Science, and a Foundation Year for students without an appropriate A level. Four undergraduate programs are offered, in Oceanography, Marine Biology, Geology and Geophysics. The Graduate School of the National Oceanography Centre Southampton offers degree programs at both Master and PhD level. Furthermore, NOCS is the lead of the Southampton Partnership for Innovative Training of Future Investigators Researching the Environment consortium, which also includes the British Antarctic Survey, Plymouth Marine Laboratory, the Natural History Museum, London, the NERC Centre for Ecology & Hydrology, and others. The consortium is funded through NERCs Doctoral Training Partnership initiative. NOCS reaches out to the general public interested to learn more about the world's oceans, marine biology and the natural environment in general. Activities and events include an annual Ocean and Earth Day, a public seminar series of marine life talks, and \"Discover Oceanography\" sessions aboard Callista. Both OES and National Oceanography Centre have joined  Athena SWAN. OES was awarded an Athena SWAN Bronze Award, showing that the wider university had \"a solid foundation for eliminating gender bias and developing an inclusive culture that values all staff\", and that the department had \"identified particular challenges\" and was \"planning activities for the future\". In July 2008 NOCS achieved ISO14001 certification (see ISO 14000) for its Environmental Management System. As part of the wider efforts to conserve electrical power and water consumption 544 solar panels and waterless urinals were installed.\n",

Franco Manca was named the UK's best Italian Restaurant on Yelp. Franco Manca's menu consists of mostly pizza with various meat and vegetarian options. It uses a traditional Neapolitan soft base. In March 2015, Franco Manca was purchased by The Fulham Shore, which also owns \u2018The Real Greek\". The Fulham Shore is owned and operated by Giuseppe Mascoli, David Page, Nabil Mankarious, and David Sykes.

Heat torches can be found in various medical instruments such as blood analyzers. In one application, a heat torch was installed inside a blood analyzer to make film cuvettes in real time, allowing blood to be stored and tested on board the instrument. Commonly referred to as a soldering torch, heat torches used in jewelry making are often fueled by butane, propane, MAPP gas, or a mixture of propane and oxygen. Heat torches are more effective at working with certain metals, such as sterling, gold, and copper, because they are able to heat these metals to a higher degree than traditional soldering irons and soldering guns. Heat torches have a wide range of use in manufacturing industries such as high-capacity staking, curing, drying, heat-shrinking, air heaters, sterilization, adhesive activation, air scrubbing and air knives. Specialized plasma heat torches can be used in construction to heat up soil, a technique that has proven to be useful for providing more solid footing for buildings and structures.

It also includes easy and instant switching between slides, customisable backgrounds, a song database, and video support. OpenLP was registered on SourceForge.net in February 2004 by Tim Ebenezer. The software was first released on 28 February 2004 as version 0. 1, and contained the bare basics of the application. Version 0. 4, released on 16 March 2004, was the first release with multi monitor support. On 18 March 2004, the 0. x line of OpenLP officially entered beta status with the release of version 0. By version 0. 8, OpenLP had implemented most of the desired functionality. Version 0. 994 was the last release in the 0. x series of OpenLP, and was released on 11 October 2004. In mid-2004 Raoul Snyman joined the project, and suggested some architectural changes. With this in mind, Tim Ebenezer decided to drop the 0. x line and rewrite OpenLP from scratch, with a redefined user interface. After various delays, OpenLP 1. 0 beta 1 was finally released on 3 October 2005. At this stage, Tim also decided to rename OpenLP to openlp.org. After the release of beta 1, Tim became too busy to work on openlp.org, and in early 2006 Raoul took over the project. After an extensive beta and release candidate program, openlp.org version 1. 0 was released on 1 February 2008. Initially, Raoul was going to work on a new version of openlp.org, version 1. 2, in order to add fix up various faults in the implementation of the software, while a new group of developers would work on OpenLP 2. 0, a new cross-platform version of the software. However, after looking at the progress of version 2. 0, and consulting the other developers, Raoul decided to cease work on version 1. In the meantime, Derek Scotney joined the project, helping Raoul work on bugfixes for openlp.org 1. When Raoul moved on to help develop version 2. 0, Derek continued to support version 1. 0 with bug fixes. In October 2009 Derek released a new version of openlp.org that he had been working on, one that provided a backing track feature that his church needed. The OpenLP team released the first alpha version of OpenLP 2. 0, OpenLP version 1. 1, after about 18 months of development. This release was a preview release to show the community what the development team had been working on. It was at this stage that the team renamed OpenLP back to its original name. Since then, there have been releases every 3 months. After over 2 years of development, the OpenLP team released their first beta of OpenLP 2. 0 on 27 March 2011. With the release of this first beta, the OpenLP team announced that there would be no more bug fix releases for openlp.org 1. 2, and that the beta release should be stable enough for most churches. Version 1. 0 of openlp.org is no longer maintained. It was superseded by version 1. Version 1. 9 was the last stable release of the Delphi version of openlp.org. It was available for Microsoft Windows only. It is no longer supported. Version 2. 0 was the first version written in Python and Qt4, allowing it to run on most major operating systems including Linux, Mac OS X and Microsoft Windows. Version 2. 2 updated the code base to Python 3 and added support for video playback through VLC and presentation support via Libreoffice versions 4.

        "reference": " served two terms in the Iowa House of Representatives and Iowa State Senate from 1961 to 1969. Ely was instrumental in abolishing capital punishment in Iowa. Ely was born to John Montague Ely, Sr. and Laurel Sullivan Ely. He graduated from Franklin High School and was educated at Coe College, the University of Iowa, and Princeton University where he received his degree in 1941. Ely served as a purser in the United States Merchant Marine from 1942 to 1945. Ely married Polly (Shirley Ward) Ely on June 20, 1942. They had three children, John Montague Ely III (Connie), Martha Ely Goralka (Joseph), and Nathaniel Ward Ely, five grandchildren and 13 great grand children. Ely was strongly opposed to capital punishment, a position reinforced after he voluntarily witnessed the execution of Victor Feguer on March 15, 1963, the most recent execution in Iowa, and the last federal execution in the United States until the execution of Timothy McVeigh on June 11, 2001. Ely recounted his memories of the execution saying \"The rope snapped, and as he hung in the air, suddenly, he took a deep breath. I dug my elbow into the Associated Press man next to me and said, 'Look, George, human life fighting to preserve itself. '\"; in fact, the breathing was the involuntary reflex of the corpse. Ely's push to abolish the state death penalty in Iowa was supported by Governor Harold Hughes, who also opposed the death penalty. Ely served from January 9, 1961 to January 10, 1965 in the Iowa House of Representatives, representing the 48th District (Linn County), and as a member of the Iowa State Senate from January 11, 1965 to January 12, 1969, representing the 20th (Polk County) and 24th (Linn County) Districts respectively. Ely's signature achievements were the successful repeal of Iowa's death penalty in 1965, his co-sponsorship of the Fair Housing Bill of Iowa, and his efforts towards establishing the Iowa Civil Rights Commission and passing the Iowa Civil Rights Act of 1965 and the Open Housing Law of 1967. Ely continued to work for the Quaker Oats Company until he retired in 1984. Among Ely's activities later in life was his work as a \"citizen-lobbyist\", pressing Congress for micro-enterprise, free primary education in developing countries, and the Global Health Fund which sought to combat HIV/AIDS. Ely was also a mentor to countless young people in the Cedar Rapids area, many of whom went on to be community leaders and activists. He died from complications of surgery in St. Luke's Hospital in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, on Friday, March 30, 2007. His cremated remains were inurned in Oak Hill Cemetery. Later in 2007, John Ely's wife, Polly Ely, accepted the Iowans Against The Death Penalty Gov. Harold E. Hughes Award on his behalf. Polly Ely died on May 15, 2008, also aged 88. Ely was remembered in 2009 in a joint memorial service for twenty-five deceased Iowa lawmakers, held at the State Senate. Ely served on the board of Planned Parenthood, the Visiting Nurses Association, and was President of the Oak Hill Cemetery Board. He was also active in the United Nations Association, the YMCA, and the Hawkeye chapter of the Iowa Civil Liberties Union, the Iowa affiliate of the American Civil Liberties Union. Ely was a member of the NAACP. He was a longtime member of the Peoples Church Unitarian-Universalist in Cedar Rapids.\n",

        "prefix": "The Danevirke (modern Danish spelling: Dannevirke; in Old Norse; Danavirki, in German; Danewerk, literally meaning",
        "reference": " earthwork of the Danes) is a system of Danish fortifications in Schleswig-Holstein, Germany. This historically important linear defensive earthwork across the neck of the Cimbrian peninsula was initiated by the Danes in the Nordic Iron Age at some point before 500 AD. It was later expanded multiple times during Denmark's Viking Age. The Danevirke was last used for military purposes in 1864 during the Second War of Schleswig. The Danevirke consists of several walls, trenches and the Schlei Barrier. The walls stretch for 30\u00a0km, from the former Viking trade centre of Hedeby near Schleswig on the Baltic Sea coast in the east to the extensive marshlands in the west of the peninsula. One of the walls (named \u00d8stervolden), between the Schlei and Eckernf\u00f6rde inlets, defended the Schwansen peninsula. According to written sources, work on the Danevirke was started by the Danish King Gudfred in 808. Fearing an invasion by the Franks, who had conquered heathen Frisia over the previous 100 years and Old Saxony in 772 to 804, Godfred began work on an enormous structure to defend his realm, separating the Jutland peninsula from the northern extent of the Frankish empire. The Danes however, were also in conflict with the Saxons south of Hedeby during the Nordic Iron Age and recent archaeological excavations have revealed that the Danevirke was initiated much earlier than King Gudfred's reign, around 500 AD and probably well before that even. Legend has it that Queen Thyra ordered the Danevirke to be built. She was the wife of the first historically recognized king of Denmark, Gorm the Old (reign c. 936 \u2013 c. 958). With the emergence of national states in Europe during the 1800s, the Danevirke became a powerful symbol for Denmark and for the idea of a unique Danish people and Danish culture. Throughout the nineteenth century, Denmark and Germany struggled politically and militarily for possession of the territory variously known as S\u00f8nderjylland or Slesvig by the Danes and Schleswig by the Germans. Two wars were fought, the First Schleswig War (1848\u20131851) and the Second Schleswig War (1864), eventually resulting in a Danish defeat and subsequent German annexation. In this hostile context, the Danevirke played an important role, at first as a mental cultural barrier against Germany, but soon also as a concrete military fortification, when it was strengthened with cannon emplacements and entrenchments in 1850 and again in 1861. In the early 1800s Dannevirke was adopted as the title of several Danish nationalist journals dealing specifically with the question of Danish autonomy vis-\u00e0-vis Germany, the most notable of these being published by N. F. S. Grundtvig in 1816\u201319. In earlier times, the Danevirke had indeed defined a cultural and linguistic border between Danish and German fiefdoms, but the cultural and linguistic frontiers had gradually moved north, and by the 19th century territory as far north as Flensburg was predominantly German-speaking, but remained part of Denmark. Archaeological excavations in 1969\u201375 established, with the help of dendrochronology, that the main structure of the Danevirke had been built in three phases between AD\u00a0737 and 968. It is, therefore, contemporary with Offa's Dyke on the border between Wales and England, another great defensive structure of the late 8th century. Recent investigations suggest that the Danevirke was not only, and not even primarily, built for military purposes. The archaeologist Henning Hellmuth Andersen found that in an early stage the main \"wall\" consisted of a ditch between two low embankments. The historian argued that the Kograben (Danish: Kovirke) south of the main wall consists of an embankment accompanied by a ditch on its northern side, which would have been counterproductive for a Danish fortification. Rather, the main construction, in its earliest stage, and the Kograben would have been shipping canals. The existence of a shortcut for shipping between the Baltic and the North Sea via the Schlei in the east and the rivers Treene and Eider in the west had long been recognized, but historians had previously believed that boats had been moved between the Schlei and Treene by portage on rollers. New carbon-14 dating in 2013 has revealed that the second stage started around 500 AD, and the oldest fortifications are even older than that. Previous carbon-14 dating had dated some of the early constructions to the second half of the 7th century, and dendrochronology also suggests that the examined constructions began not very long after 737, a few decades before the reign of king Gudfred. The Danevirke is about  long overall, with a height varying between. During the Middle Ages, the structure was reinforced with palisades and masonry walls, and was used by Danish kings as a gathering point for Danish military excursions, including a series of crusader raids against the Slavs of the south Baltic. In particular, the 12th-century King Valdemar the Great reinforced parts of the Danevirke with a brick wall, which enabled a continued military use of this strategically important structure. The reinforced parts of the structure are consequently known in Danish as Valdemarsmuren (lit: Valdemar's wall). The first Danevirke was built in five stages, starting about 650, according to carbon-14 dating. The first three stages were simple ramparts of soil, and the fourth stage was a palisade rampart with heavy timber front, built in 737. In the final stages the timber palisade was reinforced with a heavy stone wall around the timber. Work said to have been started by Angantyr, and continued by Siegfried, and ended by Gu\u00f0fri\u00f0 according to annales in 808. Hovedvolden: From Rejde \u00c5 (now called Rheider\u00a0Au) to a small lake called Dannevirke\u00a0S\u00f8. It was the main segment of the Danevirke. About 2\u00a0m high and 12\u00a0m wide. Nordvolden: From the northeastern side of Dannevirke S\u00f8, and further north about 7\u00a0km. \u00d8stervolden: About 3. 3\u00a0km long, and protecting Schwansen. A 900 m long submerged construction in Slien. Built either by Gu\u00f0fri\u00f0 or by Harald Bluetooth (if it is the work mentioned as newly made in the Frankish royal annals in 808, then Harald did not build it) it stretched from the Rheide\u00a0\u00c5 about 7\u00a0km to a southern extension of the Schlei bay which is now a lake called Selker Noor. Its palisade was about 3\u00a0m high, and was a little more solid than that on the first ramparts. The bank of earth behind the palisade was about 2\u00a0m high and 7\u00a0m wide. It had a V-shaped moat, 4\u00a0m wide and 3\u00a0m deep. The construction period of this rampart would have been some time between 770 and 970. Danevirke 3 \u2013 Hovedvolden/Hauptwall/\"main rampart\", Krumvolden/Krummwall/\"curved rampart\", Buevolden/Bogenwall/\"bow rampart\"), Dobbeltvolden/Doppelwall/\"double rampart\", Forbindelsesvolden (\"the connecting rampart\")/Margarethenwall (\"Margret's rampart\") Hovedvolden was expanded, so that it was now about 5\u00a0m high and about 20\u00a0m wide. Krumvolden was built through the Rheide\u00a0\u00c5, and overlapped with Hovedvolden. Forbindelsesvolden closed a gap between Halvkredsvolden (\"the semicircle rampart\", a bank that protected Hedeby) and Hovedvolden near Dannevirke\u00a0S\u00f8. Buevolden and Dobbeltvolden protected an important road junction. This wall is connected to most of the building work is attributed to Harald Bluetooth. Arild Hvitfeldt's Danmarks Riges Kr\u00f8nike adds a little detail to the extension of the Danevirke in that time period. \"Then summoned (Queen) Thyra (wife of Gorm the Old) Danes from all the kingdom's regions to meet at the border and under her supervision they built a wall of earth and timber from Slien over the moors to Trene. The Scanians received the western section from Karlegat to Trene. Zealanders and Funen dwellers received the section east from Slien (Schlei bay) to Karlegat. Jutlanders provided provisions to the whole army\". This would place Thyra's extension sometime before 940. Forbindelsesvolden was attacked by the Saxons of the Ottonian dynasty in 974. Danevirke 4 \u2013 Hovedvolden/Hauptwall/\"main rampart\". Reinforcement on the Main Wall finished in 954, and a new Forbindelsevold build from 964 to 968. Harald Bluetooth is thought to be the main constructor. Danevirke 5 \u2013 Forbindelsesvolden, Krumvolden, and Hovedvolden Under Canute IV of Denmark  (1080\u201386) Denmark was at war with the German empire. The Danevirke was strengthened at the beginning of the 12th century: the moats were deepened and the ramparts were made higher. A granite boulder palisade wall was built on a part of Hovedvolden. Danevirke 6 \u2013 Hovedvolden and Thyraborg Valdemar I fortified the rest of Hovedvolden with the famous \"Valdemar-wall\", a 7-m high wall of stones in mortar on a granite boulder base, propped up with buttresses and covered with tiles. This was a large reinforcement, and doubtless deterred many who tried to send an army northwards through Jutland. It was the last true reinforcement of the ramparts. Later Thyraborg castle was built. The Danevirke began to lose its purpose in the 14th century, owing both to the expense of manning it and to the development of ballistas, trebuchets, and similar siege engines. The last military use of the Danevirke was during the Second Schleswig War in 1864. Due especially to the above-mentioned emotive nationalist symbolism, public opinion in Denmark and the Danish military had expected the coming battle to take place along the Danevirke. After centuries of abandonment and decay, the Danevirke fortifications were partially restored, strengthened, and equipped with artillery installations in 1850 and 1861. In the Second War of Schleswig, there was some early skirmishing to the south of the Danevirke, but no battle took place at it, as the Danish Commander in Chief, General de Meza, withdrew all soldiers to the trenches at Dybb\u00f8l, owing to an unexpected threat of being outflanked, as the Schlei and the wetlands between the Danevirke and Husum had frozen solid in a hard winter and could be crossed easily, and the territory immediately south of the Danevirke had been conquered by the advancing German army. This retreat came as a surprise to the Austro-Prussian army, and almost all of the Danish army succeeded in completing the evacuation. It resulted, however, in the abandonment of important pieces of heavy artillery, and it remains a matter of historical debate why the railway to Flensburg was never properly used for the evacuation. News of the retreat came as a great shock to Danish public opinion which had considered the Danevirke to be impregnable, and General de\u00a0Meza was promptly relieved of his command. The Danevirke has remained in German possession ever since. Following the Allied invasion of Normandy during World War II, the Wehrmacht feared that a second Allied invasion might take place through Denmark, and contemplated converting the earthen wall into an anti-tank trench to counter this threat. Had the proposal been implemented, it would have destroyed the structure. Hearing of the plans, Danish archaeologist S\u00f8ren Telling \u2013 aware that all archaeological investigation was under the ultimate jurisdiction of SS chief Heinrich Himmler \u2013 immediately telephoned both the head of the SS's archaeological department, Amt f\u00fcr Ahnenerbe (\"Office for ancestral heritage\"), and Himmler himself. Telling argued strongly against the destruction of an important remnant of \"Aryan civilization\" and Himmler authorized him to stop the construction of the anti-tank trench. He informed Telling that a written order would be dispatched but that it would take several days to arrive. Telling then drove to the site and ordered the commanding Wehrmacht officers to immediately stop the construction process. When the local Wehrmacht commander refused, Telling threatened him with reprisals from the SS. Construction was called off and Himmler's written order arrived two days later countering the Wehrmacht's original instructions. Telling later settled near the site and considered himself a custodian of it until his death in 1968.\n",

        "reference": " original Broadway production, also contributed to the libretto. The musical uses the premise of a mysterious performance troupe, led by a Leading Player, to tell the story of Pippin, a young prince on his search for meaning and significance. The protagonist, Pippin, and his father, Charlemagne, are characters derived from two real-life individuals of the early Middle Ages, though the plot is fictional and presents no historical accuracy regarding either. The show was partially financed by Motown Records. As of April 2019, the original run of Pippin is the 36th longest-running Broadway show. Ben Vereen and Patina Miller won Tony Awards for their portrayals of the Leading Player in the original Broadway production and the 2013 revival, respectively, making them the first actors to win Tonys for Best Leading Actor and Best Leading Actress in a Musical, for the same role. Pippin was originally conceived as a student musical titled Pippin, Pippin and performed by Carnegie Mellon University's Scotch'n'Soda theatre troupe. Stephen Schwartz collaborated with Ron Strauss, and, when Schwartz decided to develop the show further, Strauss left the project. Schwartz had said that not a single line nor note from Carnegie Mellon's Pippin, Pippin made it into the final version. This musical begins with the Leading Player of a troupe and the accompanying actors in various costume pieces from several different time periods, establishing the play's intentionally anachronistic, defamiliarized, unconventional feel. The Leading Player and troupe, throughout the performance, metafictionally channel the Brechtian distancing effect and immediately break the fourth wall, directly speaking to the audience and provocatively inviting their attention (\"Magic to Do\"). They begin a story about a boy prince searching for existential fulfillment. They reveal that the boy who is to play the prince, named Pippin, is a new actor. Pippin talks to scholars of his dreams to find where he belongs (\"Corner of the Sky\"), and they happily applaud Pippin on his ambitious quest for an extraordinary life. Pippin then returns home to the castle and estate of his father, King Charles (known by the epithet \"Charlemagne\"). Charles and Pippin don't get a chance to communicate often, as they are interrupted by nobles, soldiers, and courtiers vying for Charles' attention (\"Welcome Home\"), and Charles is clearly uncomfortable speaking with his educated son or expressing any loving emotions. Pippin also meets up with his stepmother Fastrada, and her dim-witted son Lewis. Charles and Lewis are planning on going into battle against the Visigoths soon, and Pippin begs Charles to take him along so as to prove himself. Charles reluctantly agrees and proceeds to explain a battle plan to his men (\"War is a Science\"). Once in battle, the Leading Player re-enters to lead the troupe in a mock battle using top hats, canes, and fancy jazz to glorify warfare and violence (\"Glory\"), with the Leading Player and two lead dancers in the middle (performing Bob Fosse's famous \"Manson Trio\"). This charade of war does not appeal to Pippin, and he flees into the countryside. The Leading Player tells the audience of Pippin's travels through the country, until he stops at his exiled grandmother's estate (\"Simple Joys\"). There, Berthe (his paternal grandmother, exiled by Fastrada) tells Pippin not to be so serious and to live a little (\"No Time At All\"). Pippin takes this advice and decides to search for something a bit more lighthearted (\"With You\"). While he initially enjoys many meaningless sexual encounters, he soon discovers that relationships without love leave you \"empty and unfulfilled\". The Leading Player then tells Pippin that perhaps he should fight tyranny, and uses Charles as a perfect example of an uneducated tyrant to fight. Pippin plans a revolution, and Fastrada is delighted to hear that perhaps Charles and Pippin will both perish so that her beloved Lewis can become king. Fastrada arranges the murder of Charles, and Pippin falls victim to her plot (\"Spread a Little Sunshine\"). While Charles is praying at Arles, Pippin murders him, and becomes the new king (\"Morning Glow\"). The Leading Player mentions to the audience that they will break for now, but to expect a thoroughly thrilling finale. Act 2 begins with Pippin trying his best to grant the wishes of as many people as possible. But he realizes that it is impossible to keep everyone happy. Pippin realizes that neither he nor his father could change society and seemed forced to act as tyrants. He begs the Leading Player to bring his slain father back to life, and the Leading Player does so as Charlemagne nonchalantly comes back to life and mildly scolds Pippin. He feels directionless until the Leading Player inspires him (\"On the Right Track\"). After experimenting with art and religion, he falls into monumental despair and collapses on the floor. Widowed farm-owner Catherine finds him on the street, and is attracted by the arch of his foot (\"And There He Was\") and when Pippin comes to, she introduces herself to Pippin (\"Kind of Woman\"). From the start, it is clear that the Leading Player is concerned with Catherine's acting ability and actual attraction to Pippin \u2014 after all, she is but a player playing a part in the Leading Player's yet-to-be-unfolded plan. At first, Pippin thinks himself above such boring manorial duties as sweeping, repairs, and milking cows (\"Extraordinary\"), but eventually he comforts Catherine's small boy, Theo, on the sickness and eventual death of his pet duck (\u201cPrayer for a Duck\") and warms up to the lovely Catherine (\"Love Song\"). However, as time goes by, Pippin feels that he must leave the estate to continue searching for his purpose. Catherine is heartbroken and reflects on him, much to the Leading Player's anger and surprise (\"I Guess I'll Miss the Man\"). All alone on a stage, Pippin is surrounded by the Leading Player and the various troupe members. They all suggest that Pippin complete the most perfect act ever: the Finale. They tell Pippin to jump into a box of fire, light himself up, and \"become one with the flame\". Pippin is reluctant at first, but slowly loses resistance (\"Finale\"). He is stopped by his natural misgivings and also by one actress from the troupe\u2014the woman playing Catherine. Catherine and her son Theo stand by Pippin and defy the script, the Leading Player, and the Troupe. Pippin comes to the realization that the widow's home was the only place where he was truly happy (\"Magic Shows and Miracles\"). Having experimented with every possible path to fulfillment, he feels humbled, and realizes that maybe the most fulfilling road of all is a modest, ordinary life. He comes to the conclusion that, while \"settling down\" may at times be mundane and boring, \"if [he's] never tied to anything, [he'll] never be free\". The Leading Player becomes furious and calls off the show, telling the rest of the troupe and even the orchestra to pack up and leave Pippin, Catherine, and her son alone on an empty, dark and silent stage, yelling at Pippin, \"You try singing without music, sweetheart\"! Pippin realizes that he has given up his extraordinary purpose for the simplest and most ordinary life of all, and he is finally a happy man. When Catherine asks him how he feels, he says he feels \"trapped, but happy, which isn't bad for the end of a musical comedy. Tada\"! Some newer productions of Pippin, including the 2013 Broadway revival, have featured an extension to the original ending. The \"Theo ending\" was originally conceived in 1998 by Mitch Sebastian. After the troupe shuns Pippin for not performing the grand finale, and he avers his contentment with a simple life with Catherine, Theo remains alone onstage, and sings a verse of \"Corner of the Sky,\" after which the Leading Player and the troupe return, backed by the \"Magic to Do\" melody, implying that the existential crisis at the heart of the play is part of a cycle and will now continue, but with Theo as the troupe's replacement for Pippin. Current productions vary between the two possible endings, though Schwartz himself has expressed his preference for the newer ending. Though Pippin is written to be performed in one act and its single-arc structure does not easily accommodate an intermission, many performances are broken into two acts. In the two-act version currently licensed by Musical Theatre International, the intermission comes after \"Morning Glow,\" with an Act I finale\u00a0\u2013 an abridged version of \"Magic to Do\"\u00a0\u2013 inserted after Charles' murder. As with the new ending, the intermission can be added at the director's discretion without additional permission required. The 2013 Broadway revival is performed with an intermission. \u2020 Introduced by John Rubinstein in the title role on Broadway and performed by Paul Jones in the London production. The song was covered by The Jackson 5 in 1972, and is included as a bonus track on the 2000 CD release of the Original Broadway Cast Recording. A duet by Dusty Springfield and Petula Clark, whose vocals were recorded more than 30 years apart, is included on Clark's 2007 CD Duets. * The song was covered by Michael Jackson (from his 1973 album Music & Me), and is included as a bonus track on the 2000 CD release of the Original Broadway Cast Recording. \u2021 The song was covered by The Supremes in 1972, and is included as a bonus track on the 2000 CD release of the Original Broadway Cast Recording. In the original 1972 production, Fosse planned to use Stephen Schwartz's song \"Marking Time,\" but before the show opened on Broadway the song was replaced with \"Extraordinary\". The show premiered at the Imperial Theater on October 23, 1972, and ran for 1,944 performances before closing on June 12, 1977. It was directed and choreographed by Bob Fosse. Clive Barnes commented for The New York Times, \"It is a commonplace set to rock music, and I must say I found most of the music somewhat characterless. It is nevertheless consistently tuneful and contains a few rock ballads that could prove memorable\". Advertising for the Broadway production broke new ground with the first TV commercial that actually showed scenes from a Broadway show. The 60-second commercial showed Ben Vereen and two chorus dancers, Candy Brown and Pamela Sousa, in the instrumental dance sequence from \"Glory\". The commercial ended with the tagline, \"You can see the other 119 minutes of Pippin live at the Imperial Theatre, without commercial interruption\". Musical theatre scholar Scott Miller said in his 1996 book, From Assassins to West Side Story, \"Pippin is a largely under-appreciated musical with a great deal more substance to it than many people realize. Because of its 1970s pop style score and a somewhat emasculated licensed version for amateur productions, which is very different from the original Broadway production, the show now has a reputation for being merely cute and harmlessly naughty; but if done the way director Bob Fosse envisioned it, the show is surreal and disturbing\". Fosse introduced \u201cquasi-Brechtian elements\u201d  to empower audiences. Brecht\u2019s \u2018distancing effect\u2019 breaks the illusion of reality to encourage analysis of the play\u2019s meaning. The ambiguity of Pippin\u2019s \u201ctrapped, but happy\u201d line forces spectators to confront the frustrations of ordinary life as well as the fruitlessness of Pippin\u2019s attempt at revolution. Distancing empowers the spectator to think, and moreover to decide for themselves. Notable Broadway replacements include: Samuel E. Wright, Northern J. Calloway, Ben Harney, and Larry Riley as Leading Player; Michael Rupert and Dean Pitchford as Pippin; Betty Buckley as Catherine; Dorothy Stickney as Berthe; and Priscilla Lopez as Fastrada. The American Repertory Theater's production of Pippin transferred to Broadway beginning with previews on March 23, 2013 at the Music Box Theatre, followed by an opening on April 25. The same cast that performed at the A.R.T. transferred to the Broadway production: Matthew James Thomas as the title prince, Patina Miller as Leading Player, Andrea Martin as Berthe, Rachel Bay Jones as Catherine, Erik Altemus as Lewis, Terrence Mann as King Charles, Charlotte d'Amboise as Fastrada and Andrew Cekala as Theo. Diane Paulus again directed, with circus choreography and acrobatics by Chet Walker and Gypsy Snider. Miller was nervous to take on the role of the Leading Player, re-creating a character originated by the highly acclaimed Vereen. However, the challenge presented by such a role, and the representational power of the gender-blind casting, outweighed the apprehension. \u201cI know there are people who wonder why the Leading Player has to be a woman this time, but one of the great things about revivals is to be able to do things in a new and exciting way,\u201d Miller said. This revival won four categories at the 67th Tony Awards out of 10 nominations, including Best Revival, Best Leading Actress for Miller, Best Featured Actress for Martin, and Best Direction for Paulus. On April 1, 2014, the roles of Pippin and Leading Player were taken over by Kyle Dean Massey and Ciara Ren\u00e9e, respectively. The role of Berthe was taken over by Tovah Feldshuh, Annie Potts, and then Priscilla Lopez. On June 19, 2014 John Rubinstein, the original Pippin in 1972, replaced Terrence Mann in the role of Charles. From September 2, 2014 through September 21, 2014, the role of Berthe was played again by Andrea Martin, who won the Tony for her portrayal of Berthe in 2013. In September 2014, Carly Hughes replaced Ciara Renee as the Leading Player. In November, Josh Kaufman, winner of the sixth season of U.S. television series The Voice, took over the role of Pippin from Kyle Dean Massey. The Broadway revival closed on January 4, 2015. The show opened in the West End at Her Majesty's Theatre on October 30, 1973, and ran for 85 performances. Bob Fosse again was director and choreographer. Where productions of musicals are often constrained to replicate the original, Pippin empowers directors by giving them content-control. In particular, they can affect the show\u2019s tone with Pippin\u2019s final line: including \u201cbut happy\u201d maintains optimism, while omitting it creates a jaded, tragic effect. The original Australian production (a replica of the Broadway production) opened in February 1974 at Her Majesty's Theatre in Melbourne. It starred John Farnham as Pippin, with Ronne Arnold as the Leading Player, Colleen Hewett as Catherine, Nancye Hayes as Fastrada, David Ravenswood as Charles and Jenny Howard as Berthe. The production transferred to Her Majesty's Theatre in Sydney in August 1974. A cast album was released. Starring Michael Rupert as Pippin, Larry Riley as the Leading Player, Eric Berry as Charles, and Thelma Carpenter as Berthe. In their 68th season, The Muny staged a production of Pippin, directed by Ben Vereen. Vereen also reprised his original role of the Leading Player. The production was choreographed by Cathryn Doby, who was also in the original production. The cast featured: Sam Scalamoni (Pippin), Betty Ann Grove (Berthe), Ginger Prince (Fastrada), Rae Norman (Catherine), and Ed Dixon (Charles). In June 2000, the Paper Mill Playhouse in Milburn, New Jersey staged a revival with director Robert Johanson, choreographer, set design Michael Anania, costume design by Gene Meyer and Gregg Barnes, lighting design Kirk Bookman, and orchestrations by David Siegel. The cast starred Jim Newman (Lead Player), Ed Dixon (Charlemagne), Jack Noseworthy (Pippin), Natascia Diaz (Catherine), Sara Gettelfinger (Fastrada), Davis Kirby (Lewis), and Charlotte Rae (Berthe). In 2004, the first major New York revisitation of the show was featured as the second annual World AIDS Day Concert presented by Jamie McGonnigal. It featured Michael Arden as Pippin, Laura Benanti as Catherine, Julia Murney as Fastrada, Terrence Mann as Charlemagne, Charles Busch as Berthe, and the role of the Leading Player was split up among five actors including Rosie O'Donnell, Darius de Haas, Billy Porter, Kate Shindle and a surprise guest appearance by Ben Vereen, making his first New York stage appearance in over a decade. In 2005, the Bay Street Theatre in Sag Harbor, New York staged a production starring BD Wong (Leading Player), Stephanie Pope (Fastrada), Anastasia Barzee (Catherine) and James Stanek (Pippin). The production ran from August 9, 2005 through September 4, 2005. East West Players (EWP) produced a diverse and inclusive version of the musical featuring a cast with all artists of color as a part of their 42nd season under the artistic direction of Tim Dang. At the time, Pippin was the highest grossing production ever produced by EWP in their 50 year history (later surpassed by Allegiance in 2018). Stephen Schwartz had reached out to Tim Dang on multiple occasions prior to the show's run, playfully noting that EWP had a penchant for hosting the works of Stephen Sondheim while \"never [doing Schwartz's] work -- the other SS\". From this interaction, a new version of the musical was conceived. As with other interpretations of this musical, the music and aesthetics of EWP's iteration were a vast departure from the original. Both aspects of the production were heavily inspired by the animated works of Shinichir\u014d Watanabe, who is most well-known for his work on the Japanese anime series Cowboy Bebop and Samurai Champloo; as such, the production incorporated aesthetic aspects of both anime and hip-hop. The set, designed by Alan Muraoka, was constructed in the image of a dance club with characters sporting vibrantly colored costumes and slicked neon hairstyles. Dang saw this blend of cultural elements as a reflection of the youth at the time:A lot of the younger audiences, the younger performers, don\u2019t want to be defined by race anymore. They\u2019re not necessarily Asian anymore, or African American or Latino. They\u2019re this urban, metropolitan, cosmopolitan kind of generation. The show was produced in Los Angeles at the Mark Taper Forum, from January 15, 2009, through March 15, 2009, in a radically different form. The play's setting was changed to reflect a modern tone and was subtly modified to include deaf actors using American Sign Language. The production was choreographed and directed by Jeff Calhoun for actors from both the Deaf West Theatre Company and the Center Theatre Group. The title character was played by Tyrone Giordano, who was voiced by actor Michael Arden. The New York Times noted that the duality was required by the situation, but effectively showcased the character's \"lack of a fixed self\" in an exciting new fashion. Rodrick Covington (Voices of Torch Bearer Noble and Couriers No. 2 and No. 3/Courier No. John McGinty (Noble/Courier No. Anthony Natale (Torch Bearer/Petitioner/Courier No. The creative team was led by director/choreographer Mitch Sebastian. The Kansas City Repertory Theatre produced and performed a version of Pippin that opened on September 14, 2012, and closed on October 7, 2012. The score was adapted to reflect a punk-rock style by Curtis Moore and featured Mary Testa. The creative team was headed by Director Eric Rosen, Production Stage Manager Samantha Greene, Music Director/Orchestrator/Arranger Curtis Moore, Choreography Chase Brock, Scenic Design Jack Magaw, Costumes Alison Heryer, Lighting Design Jason Lyons, and Sound Design Zachary Williamson. A new production was developed for the American Repertory Theater in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The production was directed by Diane Paulus, with choreography by Chet Walker, scenic design by Scott Pask, costume design by Dominique Lemieux, lighting design by Kenneth Posner, sound design by Clive Goodwin, orchestrations by Larry Hochman, music supervision by Nadia DiGiallonardo, and music direction by Charlie Alterman. Notable in this new production are its integration of illusions by Paul Kieve and circus acts created by Gypsy Snider and performed by the Montreal-based troupe Les 7 Doigts de la Main. Composer Stephen Schwartz was present to oversee the sitzprobe. The production omits the first act number \"Welcome Home\". The A.R.T. production opened on December 5, 2012 and ran through January 20, 2013. This production transferred to Broadway with an opening on April 25, 2013. The players are Gregory Arsenal, Lolita Costet, Colin Cunliffe, Andrew Fitch, Orion Griffiths, Viktoria Grimmy, Olga Karmansky, Bethany Moore, Stephanie Pope, Philip Rosenberg, Yannick Thomas, Molly Tynes, and Anthony Wayne. A Spanish-language version of Pippin, produced by the Lily Alvarez Sierra Company in Caracas, Venezuela, directed by C\u00e9sar Sierra, opened on December 12, 2013. Pippin commenced a US tour in September 2014, at the Buell Theatre in Denver, Colorado with Sasha Allen as Leading Player, Kyle Selig as Pippin, John Rubinstein as Charles, Sabrina Harper as Fastrada, Kristine Reese as Catherine, and Lucie Arnaz as Berthe. Andrea Martin reprised her role as Berthe for the last two weeks of the San Francisco engagement and the entire Los Angeles engagement of the tour. In Dallas in summer of 2015 the role of the grandmother, Berthe, was played by Adrienne Barbeau and Pippin by Sam Lips. Gabrielle McClinton (who performed the role on Broadway as Tony Award Winner Patina Miller's  understudy) replaced Sasha Allen as Leading Player on July 29, 2015 in Chicago, and Brian Flores replaced Sam Lips as Pippin. In August 2017, a scaled down production opened at the Hope Mill Theatre in Manchester. It featured a ten-person cast and a scaled down set to focus more on the story. This production transferred in late February 2018 to the Southwark Playhouse in London for a limited run. The production starred Jonathan Carlton as Pippin and Genevieve Nicole as Leading Player. A Japanese-language version of Pippin, produced by Fuji-Television, Kyodo-Tokyo and Watanabe-Entertainment in Tokyo, directed by Daine Paulus, opened on June 10, 2019. It then commenced a tour in July in Nagaoya, Osaka and Shizuoka. In 1981, a stage production of Pippin was videotaped for Canadian television. The stage production was directed by Kathryn Doby, Bob Fosse's dance captain for the original Broadway production, and David Sheehan directed the video. Ben Vereen returned for the role of Leading Player, while William Katt played the role of Pippin. However, this version was a truncated adaptation and several sections of the play were cut. In the Broadway version Pippin describes his emotions as \"trapped, but happy,\" but in the video he says only \"trapped\". Originally, Catherine sings \"I Guess I\u2019ll Miss the Man\" after Pippin departs, but this song does not appear in the video. In 2003, Miramax acquired the feature film rights for Pippin, following the success of the film version of the musical Chicago. It was announced in April 2013 that The Weinstein Company has set director/screenwriter James Ponsoldt to pen and adapt the film. In December 2014, Craig Zadan announced that his next project with coproducer Neil Meron would be \"Pippin\", to be produced for The Weinstein Company. In April 2018, as The Weinstein Company filed for bankruptcy, the rights have quietly reverted to Schwartz and the project will soon be shopped to other studios. Several cover versions of Pippins songs have been recorded. Shortly after the show's debut, The Supremes covered \"I Guess I'll Miss the Man\" (with Jean Terrell singing the lead) and Michael Jackson covered \"Morning Glow\". The Jackson 5's single of \"Corner of the Sky\" reached #18 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1972. \"Corner of the Sky\" also became a staple of Ross' solo concerts in the 1970s. \"No Time at All\", performed by Shirley MacLaine and Darren Criss, was featured on Glees fifth-season finale.\n",

        "reference": " The album was produced by T-Bone Burnett. The album title comes from the lyrics to the Rolling Stones song \"Shattered\". It reached number 115 on the Billboard 200 chart. In 1985, the band was signed to Slash/Warner Bros and traveled to Los Angeles to begin work on their debut record shortly thereafter. The album was recorded at Sunset Sound with T-Bone Burnett along with engineers David Tickle and Tchad Blake. Due to his in-demand role as a producer, Burnett was often absent for days at a time during tracking and would return to check the band's progress and give direction. There was some tension during the sessions over how elaborate the production should be. Burnett believed that some of the band's ideas did not fit the simplicity of their songs. In addition, the band was running up high studio costs and was forced to complete the album before they felt it was finished. Despite this, the band was happy with the album and it has often been regarded as their finest work. Music critic Mark Deming, writing for AllMusic, wrote of the album: \"While this music was simple at heart, the BoDeans' passion and sincerity gave it strength, and T Bone Burnett's production allowed this band to sound as big as all outdoors. The BoDeans would enjoy greater success down the road, but they never made an album as powerful and satisfying as Love & Hope & Sex & Dreams, where their hearts and their guitars were in perfect sync\".\n",

        "reference": " to March 8, 1996. Following this trial run, it later expanded to full national syndication for one season, airing from September 9, 1996 to September 5, 1997, with reruns continuing on some stations until 2001. The show was hosted by Annie Wood (who also served as the show's co-producer) and produced by Ralph Edwards-Stu Billett Productions in cooperation with Tribune Entertainment, which distributed it to local TV stations. Reruns of the series were first aired on WGN America from 2000 to 2001 (including the original \"trial run\" season), while Buzzr\u00a0began airing the series Saturday nights starting on February 15, 2020. The show itself was a fast-paced variant of The Dating Game in which a bachelor and bachelorette competed against each other to win a date with a member of the opposite sex, as well as money. The bachelorette went first. Behind a screen, which the bachelorette could not see through, were four different men, who introduced themselves to the bachelorette one at a time. She then got to ask them each one question after their introduction. After the introductions, she chose the man she liked the least, who was set aside, but not necessarily eliminated. The bachelorette now got to interview the remaining three men in detail for a total of two minutes. The bachelorette selected one of the three remaining men to interview. If she did not like the man's answer, she pressed the \"Bzzer\", which caused the set to go dark with BZZZ! showing in red on the wall, thus eliminating him from the game. The \"Bzzz'd\" player was then immediately escorted offstage by Wood, and made to wear earphones so they could not hear why they got \"Bzzz'd\". If all three men were \"bzzz'd\", or the bachelorette's two minutes expired (though this rarely occurred), she was stuck with the man she eliminated during the introductions. However, if she liked the answer a man gives, she rang the bell. If the bachelorette rang the bell before all the men could be questioned, she was shown the remaining bachelors she turned down. Then the process is repeated with a bachelor choosing from four possible bachelorettes. Once the round is finished, round two then began. (In early episodes, the bachelor went first, and the bachelorette went second). The bachelorette and her prospective mate were given a paddle that had two different answers on it. They were both asked to go to a booth where they could not see each other's answer. The host reads a statement, and the players chose their answers, with $50 awarded each time their answers matched. If the pair got a perfect 7 out of 7, they were awarded $1,000. After seven questions, the second couple played the round. Later in the run, round two was played immediately after the first couple was formed, and again after the second couple; plus it was shortened to 5 questions, and each one was worth $100. The pair that earned the most money during Round 2 won the game, a prize package, and moved on to the Final Bzzz. Both pairs kept their money. In the event of a tie, two tiebreakers were used during the show's run. Season 1: One couple was asked a percentage question, and asked to offer an answer. The remaining couple had to guess if the correct answer was higher or lower than the answer the first couple gave. Whichever couple was more accurate, won the game. Season 2: Both couples were asked the question, and both couples offered an answer. Whichever couple was closest without going over won the game. In the event both couples were over, the winner would be the couple that went over the least. Introduced halfway through the initial trial run, this round reversed the earlier roles, with the original bachelor/bachelorette being interviewed by their prospected mate. If the mate rang the bell, the date was on, and the show paid for all the expenses. However, if the mate hit the \"Bzzer\", the date was off, and the mate was given a prize package for their trouble.\n",

        "reference": " comprise a decorated pyramidal outer frame with candle holders and a central carousel with a rotor at the top which is driven by warm air from the lit candles. The carousel is decorated with nativity scenes and other Christmas figures such as angels and wise men, as well as worldly motifs such as mining folk and forest scenes. It is suggested that the Christmas pyramid is a predecessor of the Christmas tree. These pyramids are not limited to Christmas: in the Erzgebirge there was a custom of dancing around the \"St. John's Tree\", \"a pyramid decked with garlands and flowers\", at the summer solstice. Not actually pyramid-shaped, the Christmas pyramid is a kind of carousel with several levels, some depicting Christian motifs such as angels or manger scenes, and others with more secular motifs such as mountain-folk, forests, and other scenes from the everyday life of people in the Erzgebirge. The spinning motion of the pyramids is traditionally achieved with the help of candles whose rising heat spins a propeller above. Generally Christmas pyramids are made of wood and based on four- to eight-sided platforms with a long pole in the middle serving as the axle to which the entire apparatus tapers above and which supports any further platforms. Inside in a glass or ceramic support is a driveshaft on to which at least one platform is attached. The figures, which stand on the platforms are also traditionally made of wood. Christmas pyramids take various forms from intricately carved miniature houses with pitched roofs, to large multi-level structures that simply serve as a display for the carved figures. In many cities in the Ore Mountains there are large Christmas pyramids on the Market Square at the Christmas Market or in other locations associated with Christmas hustle and bustle. Most of the pyramids demonstrate nativity scenes. They include the story of the Christ child being born, of shepherds and wise men visiting the child, and of angels rejoicing in heaven  The nativity scene often is placed on the longest shelf at the bottom of the pyramid, while a pine cone or a star would crown the top. Christmas pyramids were originally hung from the ceiling of German families' houses. The custom spread across Europe, mainly to Italy and England and was brought to America by German immigrants in the 1700s. The origins of the Christmas pyramids date back to the Middle Ages. In this period it was traditional in southern and western Europe to bring evergreen branches, for example boxwood, into the home and hang them in order to ward off moroseness in the dark and cold winter months. In northern and eastern Europe traditional candles were used to achieve this goal. The Christmas pyramid would eventually unify these two traditions and become a symbol of Christmas celebrations. The forerunner of the pyramid was a construction known as a Lichtergestelle (literally: light stand) which were very popular in the 18th century. They were constructions made of four poles, decorated with evergreen boughs, tied together at the top and lit with candles. In the large cities, the Christmas tree, now recognizable all over the world, gradually replaced the Lichtergestelle, but in the mountains, the people did not see a simple tree bedecked with lights; rather they were reminded of the capstans, which were commonly used in the mines of the Ore Mountains. To the pyramid shape was added the spinning motion of the capstan and the earliest Christmas pyramids were born. The name \"Christmas pyramid\" came about because the Napoleonic Campaign in Egypt at the end of the 18th century brought pictures of the pyramids back to Europe and eventually to the Ore Mountains, where they reminded the people of the mining capstans and also of the Christmas constructions. An important breakthrough in the popularity of the Christmas pyramid came around 1830 with the discovery of kerosene. Previously, people had used relatively expensive candles or rapeseed oil. As the means to light and spin the pyramids became much cheaper, the tradition spread. Now such pyramids can be found in numerous styles and sizes all over Germany as well as in many parts of the United States.\n",

        "reference": " ) was a state in Southeast and Central Europe that existed from 1918 until 1941, during the interwar period and beginning of World War II. From 1918 to 1929, it was officially called the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes ( / \u041a\u0440\u0430\u0459\u0435\u0432\u0438\u043d\u0430 \u0421\u0440\u0431\u0430, \u0425\u0440\u0432\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u0438 \u0421\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0435\u043d\u0430\u0446\u0430; ), but the term \"Yugoslavia\" (literally \"Land of Southern Slavs\") was its colloquial name due to its origins. The official name of the state was changed to \"Kingdom of Yugoslavia\" by King Alexander I on 3 October 1929. The preliminary kingdom was formed in 1918 by the merger of the provisional State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs (itself formed from territories of the former Austro-Hungarian Empire, encompassing Bosnia and Herzegovina and most of Croatia and Slovenia) with the formerly independent Kingdom of Serbia. The Kingdom of Montenegro had united with Serbia five days previously, whereas the regions of Kosovo, Vojvodina, and Vardar Macedonia had become parts of Serbia prior to the unification. The state was ruled by the Serbian dynasty of Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107, which previously ruled the Kingdom of Serbia under Peter I from 1903 (after the May Overthrow) onward. Peter I became the first king of Yugoslavia until his death in 1921. He was succeeded by his son Alexander I, who had been regent for his father. He was known as \"Alexander the Unifier\" and he renamed the kingdom \"Yugoslavia\" in 1929. He was assassinated in Marseille by Vlado Chernozemski, a member of the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization (IMRO), during his visit to France in 1934. The crown passed to his then-still under-aged son Peter. Alexander's cousin Paul ruled as Prince regent until 1941, when Peter II came of age. The royal family flew to London the same year, prior to the country being invaded by the Axis powers. In April 1941, the country was occupied and partitioned by the Axis powers. A royal government-in-exile, recognized by the United Kingdom and, later, by all the Allies, was established in London. In 1944, after pressure from the British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, the King recognized the government of Democratic Federal Yugoslavia as the legitimate government. This was established on 2 November following the signing of the Treaty of Vis by Ivan \u0160uba\u0161i\u0107 (on behalf of the Kingdom) and Josip Broz Tito (on behalf of the Yugoslav Partisans). Following the assassination of Austrian Archduke Francis Ferdinand by the Bosnian Serb Gavrilo Princip, which led to the outbreak of World War I, and the subsequent invasion and military occupation of Serbia. South Slavic nationalism escalated and Slavic nationalists called for the independence and unification of the South Slavic nationalities of Austria-Hungary along with Serbia and Montenegro into a single State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs. The Dalmatian Croat politician Ante Trumbi\u0107 became a prominent South Slavic leader during the war and led the Yugoslav Committee that lobbied the Allies to support the creation of an independent Yugoslavia. Trumbi\u0107 faced initial hostility from Serbian Prime Minister Nikola Pa\u0161i\u0107, who preferred an enlarged Serbia over a unified Yugoslav state. However, both Pa\u0161i\u0107 and Trumbi\u0107 agreed to a compromise, which was delivered at the Corfu Declaration on 20 July 1917 that advocated the creation of a united state of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes to be led by the Serbian House of Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107. In 1916, the Yugoslav Committee started negotiations with the Serbian Government in exile, on which they decided on the creation of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, declaring the joint Corfu Declaration in 1917, the meetings were held at the Municipal Theatre of Corfu. In November 1918 the National Council of the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs appointed 28 members to start negotiation with the representatives of the government of the Kingdom of Serbia and Montenegro on creation of a new Yugoslav state, the delegation negotiated directly with regent Alexander Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107. The negotiations would end, with the delegation of the National Council of the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs led by Ante Paveli\u0107 reading the address in front of regent Alexander, who represented his father, King Peter I of Serbia, by which acceptance the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes was established. The name of the new Yugoslav state was: \"Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes\" ( / \u041a\u0440\u0430\u0459\u0435\u0432\u0438\u043d\u0430 \u0421\u0440\u0431\u0430, \u0425\u0440\u0432\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u0438 \u0421\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0435\u043d\u0430\u0446\u0430; ) or its abbreviated form \"Kingdom of SHS\" (Kraljevina SHS / \u041a\u0440\u0430\u0459\u0435\u0432\u0438\u043d\u0430 \u0421\u0425\u0421). The new kingdom was made up of the formerly independent kingdoms of Serbia and Montenegro (Montenegro having been absorbed into Serbia the previous month), and of a substantial amount of territory that was formerly part of Austria\u2013Hungary, the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs. The creation of the state was supported by pan-Slavists and Yugoslav nationalists. For the pan-Slavic movement, all of the South Slav (Yugoslav) people had united into a single state. The newly established Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes participated in the Paris Peace Conference with Trumbi\u0107 as the country's representative. Since the Allies had lured the Italians into the war with a promise of substantial territorial gains in exchange, which cut off a quarter of Slovene ethnic territory from the remaining three-quarters of Slovenes living in the Kingdom of SHS, Trumbi\u0107 successfully vouched for the inclusion of most Slavs living in the former Austria-Hungary to be included within the borders of the new Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. Nevertheless, with the Treaty of Rapallo a population of half a million Slavs, mostly Slovenes, were subjected to forced Italianization until the fall of Fascism in Italy. At the time when Benito Mussolini was willing to modify the Rapallo borders in order to annex the independent state of Rijeka to Italy, Pa\u0161i\u0107's attempts to correct the borders at Postojna and Idrija were effectively undermined by the regent Alexander who preferred \"good relations\" with Italy. The Yugoslav kingdom bordered Italy and Austria to the northwest at the Rapallo border, Hungary and Romania to the north, Bulgaria to the east, Greece and Albania to the south, and the Adriatic Sea to the west. Almost immediately, it ran into disputes with most of its neighbours. Slovenia was difficult to determine, since it had been an integral part of Austria for 400 years. The Vojvodina region was disputed with Hungary, Macedonia with Bulgaria, Fiume with Italy. A plebiscite was also held in the Province of Carinthia, which opted to remain in Austria. Austrians had formed a majority in this region although numbers reflected that some Slovenes did vote for Carinthia to become part of Austria. The Dalmatian port city of Zadar () and a few of the Dalmatian islands were given to Italy. The city of Rijeka () was declared to be the Free State of Fiume, but it was soon occupied, and in 1924 annexed, by Italy, which had also been promised the Dalmatian coast during World War I, and Yugoslavia claiming Istria, a part of the former Austrian Littoral which had been annexed to Italy, but which contained a considerable population of Croats and Slovenes. The formation of the constitution of 1921 sparked tensions between the different Yugoslav nationalities. Trumbi\u0107 opposed the 1921 constitution and over time grew increasingly hostile towards the Yugoslav government that he saw as being centralized in the favour of Serb hegemony over Yugoslavia. Three-quarters of the Yugoslav workforce was engaged in agriculture. A few commercial farmers existed, but most were subsistence peasants. Those in the south were especially poor, living in a hilly, infertile region. No large estates existed except in the north, and all of those were owned by foreigners. Indeed, one of the first actions undertaken by the new Yugoslav state in 1919 was to break up the estates and dispose of foreign, and in particular Magyar landowners. Nearly 40% of the rural population was surplus (i.e., excess people not needed to maintain current production levels), and despite a warm climate, Yugoslavia was also relatively dry. Internal communications were poor, damage from World War I had been extensive, and with few exceptions agriculture was devoid of machinery or other modern farming technologies. Manufacturing was limited to Belgrade and the other major population centers, and consisted mainly of small, comparatively primitive facilities that produced strictly for the domestic market. The commercial potential of Yugoslavia's Adriatic ports went to waste because the nation lacked the capital or technical knowledge to operate a shipping industry. On the other hand, the mining industry was well developed due to the nation's abundance of mineral resources, but since it was primarily owned and operated by foreigners, most production was exported. Yugoslavia was the third least industrialized nation in Eastern Europe after Bulgaria and Albania. Yugoslavia was typical of Eastern European nations in that it borrowed large sums of money from the West during the 1920s. When the Great Depression began in 1929, the Western lenders called in their debts, which could not be paid back. Some of the money was lost to graft, although most was used by farmers to improve production and export potential. Agricultural exports, however, were always an unstable prospect as their export earnings were heavily reliant on volatile world market prices. The Great Depression caused the market for them to collapse as global demand contracted heavily and the situation for export-oriented farmers further deteriorated when nations everywhere started to erect trade barriers. Italy was a major trading partner of Yugoslavia in the initial years after World War I, but ties fell off after Benito Mussolini came to power in 1922. In the grim economic situation of the 1930s, Yugoslavia followed the lead of its neighbors in allowing itself to become a dependent of Nazi Germany. The small middle class occupied the major population centers and almost everyone else were peasants engaged in subsistence agriculture. The largest ethnic group were Serbs followed by Croats, Slovenes, Bosnian Muslims (now known as Bosniaks), Macedonians and Albanians. Religion followed the same pattern with half the population following Orthodox Christianity, around 40 percent being Catholic, and the rest Muslim. In such a polyglot nation, tensions were frequent, but especially between Serbs and Croats. Other quarrels were those between Serbs and Macedonians, as the Yugoslav government had as its official position that the latter were ethnic Serbs. In the early 20th century the international community viewed the Macedonians predominantly as regional variety of Bulgarians, but during the Paris Peace Conference of 1919, the Allies sanctioned the Serbian control of Vardar Macedonia and its view, that Macedonian Slavs were in fact Southern Serbs. The predominantly Muslim Bosniaks won some concessions from the government in Belgrade. Albanians fared worse since they did not speak Serbo-Croatian, but all Muslims were the subject of widespread prejudice in Yugoslavia. Some regions of the country were allowed to exist as enclaves of Islamic law regarding personal status, which was a concession made to the Muslim population of Yugoslavia. Other lesser minorities included Italians, Romanians, Germans, Magyars and Greeks. Aside from the Romanians, the Yugoslav government awarded no special treatment to them in terms of respect for their language, culture, or political autonomy, not surprising given that all of their native countries had territorial disputes with Yugoslavia. Several thousand Jews lived mostly in major cities; they were well-assimilated and there were no significant problems with anti-Semitism. Although Yugoslavia had enacted a compulsory public education policy, it was inaccessible to many peasants in the countryside. Official literacy figures for the population stood at 50%, but it varied widely throughout the country. Less than 10% of Slovenes were illiterate, whereas over 80% of Macedonians and Bosnians could not read or write. Only 10% of initial elementary school students went on to attend higher forms of education, at one of the country's three universities in Belgrade, Ljubljana, and Zagreb. Immediately after the 1 December proclamation, negotiations between the National Council of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs and the Serbian government resulted in agreement over the new government which was to be headed by Nikola Pa\u0161i\u0107. However, when this agreement was submitted to the approval of the regent, Alexander Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107, it was rejected, producing the new state's first governmental crisis. Many regarded this rejection as a violation of parliamentary principles, but the matter was resolved when the regent suggested replacing Pa\u0161i\u0107 with Stojan Proti\u0107, a leading member of Pa\u0161i\u0107's Radical Party. The National Council and the Serbian government agreed and the new government came into existence on 20 December 1918. In this period before the election of the Constituent Assembly, a Provisional Representation served as a parliament which was formed by delegates from the various elected bodies that had existed before the creation of the state. A realignment of parties combining several members of the Serbian opposition with political parties from the former Austria\u2013Hungary led to the creation of a new party, The Democratic Party, that dominated the Provisional Representation and the government. Because the Democratic Party led by Ljubomir Davidovi\u0107 pushed a highly centralized agenda a number of Croatian delegates moved into opposition. However, the radicals themselves were not happy that they had only three ministers to the Democratic Party's 11 and, on 16 August 1919, Proti\u0107 handed in his resignation. Davidovi\u0107 then formed a coalition with the Social Democrats. This government had a majority, but the quorum of the Provisional Representation was half plus one vote. The opposition then began to boycott the parliament. As the government could never guarantee that all of its supporters would turn up, it became impossible to hold a quorate meeting of the parliament. Davidovi\u0107 soon resigned, but as no one else could form a government he again became prime minister. As the opposition continued their boycott, the government decided it had no alternative but to rule by decree. This was denounced by the opposition who began to style themselves as the Parliamentary Community. Davidovi\u0107 realized that the situation was untenable and asked the King to hold immediate elections for the Constituent Assembly. When the King refused, he felt he had no alternative but to resign. The Parliamentary Community now formed a government led by Stojan Proti\u0107 committed to the restoration of parliamentary norms and mitigating the centralization of the previous government. Their opposition to the former governments program of radical land reform also united them. As several small groups and individuals switched sides, Proti\u0107 now even had a small majority. However, the Democratic Party and the Social Democrats now boycotted parliament and Proti\u0107 was unable to muster a quorum. Hence the Parliamentary Community, now in government, was forced to rule by decree. For the Parliamentary Community to thus violate the basic principle around which they had formed put them in an extremely difficult position. In April 1920, widespread worker unrest and a railway strike broke out. According to Gligorijevi\u0107, this put pressure on the two main parties to settle their differences. After successful negotiations, Proti\u0107 resigned to make way for a new government led by the neutral figure of Milenko Vesni\u0107. The Social Democrats did not follow the Democratic Party, their former allies, into government because they were opposed to the anti-communist measures to which the new government was committed. The controversies that had divided the parties earlier were still very much live issues. The Democratic Party continued to push its agenda of centralization and still insisted on the need for radical land reform. A disagreement over electoral law finally led the Democratic Party to vote against the government in Parliament and the government was defeated. Though this meeting had not been quorate, Vesni\u0107 used this as a pretext to resign. His resignation had the intended effect: the Radical Party agreed to accept the need for centralization, and the Democratic Party agreed to drop its insistence on land reform. Vesni\u0107 again headed the new government. The Croatian Community and the Slovenian People's Party were however not happy with the Radicals' acceptance of centralization. Neither was Stojan Proti\u0107, and he withdrew from the government on this issue. In September 1920 a peasant revolt broke out in Croatia, the immediate cause of which was the branding of the peasants' cattle. The Croatian community blamed the centralizing policies of the government and of minister Svetozar Pribi\u0107evi\u0107 in particular. One of the few laws successfully passed by the Provisional Representation was the electoral law for the constituent assembly. During the negotiations that preceded the foundation of the new state, it had been agreed that voting would be secret and based on universal suffrage. It had not occurred to them that universal might include women until the beginning of a movement for women's suffrage appeared with the creation of the new state. The Social Democrats and the Slovenian People's Party supported women's suffrage but the Radicals opposed it. The Democratic Party was open to the idea but not committed enough to make an issue of it so the proposal fell. Proportional Representation was accepted in principle but the system chosen (d'Hondt with very small constituencies) favored large parties and parties with strong regional support. The election was held on 28 November 1920. When the votes were counted the Democratic Party had won the most seats, more than the Radicals \u2013 but only just. For a party that had been so dominant in the Provisional Representation, that amounted to a defeat. Further it had done rather badly in all former Austria-Hungarian areas. That undercut the party's belief that its centralization policy represented the will of the Yugoslavian people as a whole. The Radicals had done no better in that region but this presented them far less of a problem because they had campaigned openly as a Serbian party. The most dramatic gains had been made by the two anti-system parties. The Croatian Republican Peasant Party's leadership had been released from prison only as the election campaign began to get underway. According to Gligorijevi\u0107, this had helped them more than active campaigning. The Croatian community (that had in a timid way tried to express the discontent that Croatian Republican Peasant Party mobilized) had been too tainted by their participation in government and was all but eliminated. The other gainers were the communists who had done especially well in the wider Macedonia region. The remainder of the seats were taken up by smaller parties that were at best skeptical of the centralizing platform of the Democratic Party. The results left Nikola Pa\u0161i\u0107 in a very strong position as the Democrats had no choice but to ally with the Radicals if they wanted to get their concept of a centralized Yugoslavia through. Pa\u0161i\u0107 was always careful to keep open the option of a deal with the Croatian opposition. The Democrats and the Radicals were not quite strong enough to get the constitution through on their own and they made an alliance with the Yugoslav Muslim Organization (JMO). The Muslim party sought and got concessions over the preservation of Bosnia in its borders and how the land reform would affect Muslim landowners in Bosnia. The Croatian Republican Peasant Party refused to swear allegiance to the King on the grounds that this presumed that Yugoslavia would be a monarchy, something that it contended only the Constituent Assembly could decide. The party was unable to take its seats. Most of the opposition though initially taking their seats declared boycotts as time went so that there were few votes against. However, the constitution decided against 1918 agreement between the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs and the Kingdom of Serbia, which stated that a 66% majority that 50% plus one vote would be needed to pass, irrespective of how many voted against. Only last minute concessions to D\u017eemijet, a group of Muslims from Macedonia and Kosovo, saved it. On 28 June 1921, the Vidovdan (St Vitus's Day) Constitution was passed, establishing a unitary monarchy. The pre\u2013World War I traditional regions were abolished and 33 new administrative oblasts (provinces) ruled from the center were instituted. Ljubomir Davidovi\u0107 of the Democrats began to have doubts about the wisdom of his party's commitment to centralization and opened up negotiations with the opposition. This threatened to provoke a split in his party as his action was opposed Svetozar Pribi\u0107evi\u0107. It also gave Pa\u0161i\u0107 a pretext to end the coalition. At first the King gave Pa\u0161i\u0107 a mandate to form a coalition with Pribi\u0107evi\u0107's Democrats. However, Pa\u0161i\u0107 offered Pribi\u0107evi\u0107 too little for there to be much chance that Pribi\u0107evi\u0107 would agree. A purely Radical government was formed with a mandate to hold elections. The Radicals made gains at the expense of the Democrats but elsewhere there were gains by Radi\u0107's Peasant's Party. Serb politicians around Radic regarded Serbia as the standard bearer of Yugoslav unity, as the state of Piedmont had been for Italy, or Prussia for the German Empire; a kind of \"Greater Serbia\". Over the following years, Croatian resistance against a Serbo-centric policy increased. In the early 1920s, the Yugoslav government of prime minister Nikola Pa\u0161i\u0107 used police pressure over voters and ethnic minorities, confiscation of opposition pamphlets and other measure to rig elections. This was ineffective against the Croatian Peasant Party (formerly the Croatian Republican Peasant Party), whose members continued to win election to the Yugoslav parliament in large numbers, but did harm the Radicals' main Serbian rivals, the Democrats. Stjepan Radi\u0107, the head of the Croatian Peasant Party, was imprisoned many times for political reasons. He was released in 1925 and returned to parliament. In the spring of 1928, Radi\u0107 and Svetozar Pribi\u0107evi\u0107 waged a bitter parliamentary battle against the ratification of the Nettuno Convention with Italy. In this they mobilised nationalist opposition in Serbia but provoked a violent reaction from the governing majority including death threats. On 20 June 1928, a member of the government majority, the Serb deputy Puni\u0161a Ra\u010di\u0107, shot five members of the Croatian Peasant Party, including their leader Stjepan Radi\u0107, after Radi\u0107 refused to apologize for earlier offense in which he accused Ra\u010di\u0107 of stealing from civilian population. Two died on the floor of the Assembly while the life of Radi\u0107 hung in the balance. The opposition now completely withdrew from parliament, declaring that they would not return to a parliament in which several of their representatives had been killed, and insisting on new elections. On 1 August, at a meeting in Zagreb, they renounced 1 December Declaration of 1920. They demanded that the negotiations for unification should begin from scratch. On 8 August Stjepan Radi\u0107 died. On 6 January 1929, using as a pretext the political crisis triggered by the shooting, King Alexander abolished the Constitution, prorogued the Parliament and introduced a personal dictatorship (known as the \"January 6 Dictatorship\", \u0160estosije\u010danjska diktatura, \u0160estojanuarska diktatura). He changed the name of the country to \"Kingdom of Yugoslavia\", and changed the internal divisions from the 33 oblasts to nine new banovinas on 3 October. This decision was made following a proposal by the British ambassador to better decentralize the country, modeled on Czechoslovakia. This political move was aimed at bringing ethnic communities into one Yugoslav nation. A Court for the Protection of the State was soon established to act as the new regime's tool for putting down any dissent. Opposition politicians Vladko Ma\u010dek and Svetozar Pribi\u0107evi\u0107 were arrested under charges by the court. Pribi\u0107evi\u0107 later went into exile, whereas over the course of the 1930s Ma\u010dek would become the leader of the entire opposition bloc. Immediately after the dictatorship was proclaimed, Croatian deputy Ante Paveli\u0107 left for exile from the country. The following years Paveli\u0107 worked to establish a revolutionary organization, the Usta\u0161e, allied with the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization (IMRO) against the state. In 1931, Alexander decreed a new Constitution which made executive power the gift of the King. Elections were to be by universal male suffrage. The provision for a secret ballot was dropped, and pressure on public employees to vote for the governing party was to be a feature of all elections held under Alexander's constitution. Further, half the upper house was directly appointed by the King, and legislation could become law with the approval of one of the houses alone if also approved by the King. That same year, Croatian historian and anti-Yugoslavist intellectual Milan \u0160ufflay was assassinated in Zagreb. As a response, Albert Einstein and Heinrich Mann sent an appeal to the International League of Human Rights in Paris condemning the murder, accusing the Yugoslav government. The letter states of a \"horrible brutality which is being practiced upon the Croatian People\". The appeal was addressed to the Paris-based Ligue des droits de l'homme (Human Rights League). In their letter Einstein and Mann held the Yugoslav king Aleksandar explicitly responsible for these circumstances. Croat opposition to the new r\u00e9gime was strong and, in late 1932, the Croatian Peasant Party issued the Zagreb Manifesto which sought an end to Serb hegemony and dictatorship. The government reacted by imprisoning many political opponents including the new Croatian Peasant Party leader Vladko Ma\u010dek. Despite these measures, opposition to the dictatorship continued, with Croats calling for a solution to what was called the \"Croatian question\". In late 1934, the King planned to release Ma\u010dek from prison, introduce democratic reforms, and attempt find common ground between Serbs and Croats. However, on 9 October 1934, the king was assassinated in Marseille, France by Bulgarian Veli\u010dko Kerin (also known by his revolutionary pseudonym Vlado Chernozemski), an activist of IMRO, in a conspiracy with Yugoslav exiles and radical members of banned political parties in cooperation with the Croatian extreme nationalist Usta\u0161e organisation. Because Alexander's eldest son, Peter II, was a minor, a regency council of three, specified in Alexander's will, took over the new king's royal powers and duties. The council was dominated by the 11-year-old king's first cousin once removed Prince Paul. In the late 1930s, internal tensions continued to increase with Serbs and Croats seeking to establish ethnic federal subdivisions. Serbs wanted Vardar Banovina (later known within Yugoslavia as Vardar Macedonia), Vojvodina, Montenegro united with the Serb lands, and Croatia wanted Dalmatia and some of Vojvodina. Both sides claimed territory in present-day Bosnia and Herzegovina populated by Bosniak Muslims. The expansion of Nazi Germany in 1938 gave new momentum to efforts to solve these problems and, in 1939, Prince Paul appointed Dragi\u0161a Cvetkovi\u0107 as prime minister, with the goal of reaching an agreement with the Croatian opposition. Accordingly, on 26 August 1939, Vladko Ma\u010dek became vice premier of Yugoslavia and an autonomous Banovina of Croatia was established with its own parliament. These changes satisfied neither Serbs who were concerned with the status of the Serb minority in the new Banovina of Croatia and who wanted more of Bosnia and Herzegovina as Serbian territory. The Croatian nationalist Usta\u0161e were also angered by any settlement short of full independence for a Greater Croatia including all of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Fearing an invasion by the Axis powers, Yugoslavia signed the Tripartite Pact on 25 March 1941, pledging cooperation with the Axis. Massive anti-Axis demonstrations followed in Belgrade. On 27 March, the regime of Prince Paul was overthrown by a military coup d'\u00e9tat with British support. The 17-year-old Peter II was declared to be of age and placed in power. General Du\u0161an Simovi\u0107 became his Prime Minister. The Kingdom of Yugoslavia withdrew its support for the Axis de facto without formally renouncing the Tripartite Pact. Although the new rulers opposed Nazi Germany, they also feared that if German dictator Adolf Hitler attacked Yugoslavia, the United Kingdom was not in any real position to help. Regardless of this, on 6 April 1941, the Axis powers launched the invasion of Yugoslavia and quickly conquered it. The royal family, including Prince Paul, escaped abroad and were interned by the British in Kenya. The Kingdom of Yugoslavia was soon divided by the Axis into several entities. Germany, Italy, Hungary, and Bulgaria annexed some border areas outright. A Greater Germany was expanded to include most of Slovenia. Italy added the Governorship of Dalmatia, part of Macedonia and Kosovo, Montenegro, southerly part of Croatia, and more than a third of western Slovenia to the Italian Empire. An expanded Croatia was recognized by the Axis as the Independent State of Croatia (Nezavisna Dr\u017eava Hrvatska, NDH). On paper, the NDH was a kingdom and the 4th Duke of Aosta was crowned as King Tomislav II of Croatia. The rump Serbian territory became a military administration of Germany run by military governors and a Serb civil government led by Milan Nedi\u0107. Nedi\u0107 attempted to gain German recognition of Serbia as a successor state to Yugoslavia and claimed King Peter II as Serbia's monarch. Hungary occupied several northern regions. King Peter II, who had escaped into exile, was still recognized as King of the whole state of Yugoslavia by the Allies. From 13 May 1941, the largely Serbian \"Yugoslav Army of the Fatherland\" (Jugoslovenska vojska u otad\u017ebini, or JVUO, or \u010cetniks) resisted the Axis occupation of Yugoslavia. This anti-German and anti-communist resistance movement was commanded by Royalist General Dra\u017ea Mihailovi\u0107. For a long time, the \u010cetniks were supported by the British, the United States, and the Yugoslavian royal government in exile of King Peter II. However, over the course of the war, effective power changed to the hands of Josip Broz Tito's Communist Partisans. In 1943, Tito proclaimed the creation of the Democratic Federative Yugoslavia (Demokratska federativna Jugoslavija). The Allies gradually recognized Tito's forces as the stronger opposition forces to the German occupation. They began to send most of their aid to Tito's Partisans, rather than to the Royalist \u010cetniks. On 16 June 1944, the Tito\u2013\u0160uba\u0161i\u0107 agreement was signed which merged the de facto and the de jure government of Yugoslavia. In early 1945, after the Germans had been driven out, the Kingdom of Yugoslavia was formally restored on paper. But real political power was held by Tito's Communist Partisans. On 29 November, King Peter II was deposed (and the monarchy abolished) by Yugoslavia's Communist Constituent Assembly while he was still in exile. On 2 December, the Communist authorities claimed the entire territory as part of the Democratic Federal Yugoslavia. The new Yugoslavia covered roughly the same territory as the Kingdom had, but it was no longer a unitary monarchy but a federal republic ruled by a Communist Party. The Kingdom nourished a close relationship with the Allies of World War I. This was especially the case between 1920 and 1934 with Yugoslavia's traditional supporters of Britain and France. From 1920, the Kingdom of Yugoslavia had formed the Little Entente with Czechoslovakia and Romania, with the support of France. The primary aim of the alliance was to prevent Hungary from regaining the territories it had lost after the First World War. The alliance lost its significance in 1937 when Yugoslavia and Romania refused to support Czechoslovakia, then threatened by Germany, in the event of military aggression. In 1924, the Kingdom of Yugoslavia formed a Balkan Bloc with Greece, Romania, and Turkey that was intent on keeping balance on the Balkan peninsula. The alliance was formalized and entrenched on 9 February 1934 when it became the \"Balkan Entente\". In 1934, with the assassination of King Alexander I by Vlado Chernozemski in Marseille and the shifting of Yugoslav foreign policy, the alliance crumbled. The Kingdom of Italy had territorial ambitions against the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. Relations between Italy and the kingdom's predecessors, the Kingdom of Serbia and the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs became sour and hostile during World War I, as Italian and Yugoslav politicians were in dispute over the region of Dalmatia which Italy demanded as part of Italy. These hostile relations were demonstrated on 1 November 1918, when Italian forces sunk the recently captured Austro-Hungarian battleship SMS Viribus Unitis being used by the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs. Italy formed a coalition against it with states with similar state designs, heavily influenced by Italy and/or fascism: Albania, Hungary, Romania and Bulgaria which lasted from 1924 to 1927. The 1927 cooperation with Britain and France made Italy withdraw from its anti-Yugoslav alliance. Italian Fascist dictator Benito Mussolini accepted the extreme Croatian nationalist Ustase movement of Ante Paveli\u0107 to reside in Italy and use training grounds in Italy to prepare for war with Yugoslavia. Hungary also permitted such Ustase training camps as well. Mussolini allowed Paveli\u0107 to reside in Rome. In 1927, in response to the growing Italian expansionism, the royal government of Yugoslavia signed an agreement of friendship and cooperation with the United Kingdom and France. Officially, the last words of King Aleksandar had been \"Save Yugoslavia, and the friendship with France\". His successors were well aware of the need to try and do the first, but the second, maintaining close ties with France, was increasingly difficult. There were several reasons for this. By the mid-1930s, France, internally divided, was increasingly unable to play an important role in Eastern Europe and support its allies, many of whom had suffered badly from the economic crisis of that period. By contrast, Germany was increasingly willing to get into barter agreements with the countries of south east Europe. In the process those countries felt it was against their interests to closely follow France. An additional motive to improve relations with Italy and Germany was Italy's support of the Ustase movement. As Ma\u010dek intimated Italy would support Croatian secession from Yugoslavia, First Regent Prince Paul judged closer relations with Italy were inevitable. In an effort to rob the HSS from potential Italian support, a treaty of friendship was signed between the two countries in 1937. This diminished the Ustasa threat somewhat since Mussolini imprisoned some of their leaders and temporarily withdrew financial support. In 1938, Germany, annexing Austria, became a neighbour of Yugoslavia. The feeble reaction of France and Britain, later that year, during the Sudeten Crisis convinced Belgrade that a European war was inevitable and that it would be unwise to support France and Britain. Instead, Yugoslavia tried to stay aloof, this in spite of Paul's personal sympathies for Britain and Serbia's establishment's predilections for France. In the meantime, Germany and Italy tried to exploit Yugoslavia's domestic problems, and so did Ma\u010dek. In the end, the regency agreed to the formation of the Banovina hrvatska in August 1939. This did not put an end to the pressures from Germany and Italy, and Yugoslavia's strategic position deteriorated by the day. It was increasingly dependent on the German market, about 90% of its exports went to Germany, and in April 1939 Italy invaded and annexed Albania. In October 1940 it attacked Greece, by when France had already been eliminated from the scene, leaving Britain as Yugoslavia's only potential ally \u2013 given that Belgrade had not recognized the Soviet Union. London however wanted to involve Yugoslavia in the war, which it rejected. From late 1940, Hitler wanted Belgrade to unequivocally choose sides. Pressure intensified, culminating in the signing of the Tripartite Pact on 25 March 1941. Two days later, Prince Paul was deposed in a coup d'\u00e9tat and his nephew Peter II was proclaimed of age, but the new government, headed by General Simovi\u0107, assured Germany it would adhere to the Pact. Hitler nonetheless ordered the invasion of Yugoslavia. On 6 April 1941, Belgrade was bombed; on 10 April, the Independent State of Croatia was proclaimed; and on 17 April, the weak Yugoslav Army capitulated. After the invasion, the Yugoslav royal government went into exile and local Yugoslav forces rose up in resistance to the occupying Axis powers. Initially the monarchy preferred Dra\u017ea Mihailovi\u0107 and his Serb-dominated \u010cetnik resistance. However, in 1944, the Tito\u2013\u0160uba\u0161i\u0107 agreement recognised the Democratic Federal Yugoslavia as a provisional government, with the status of the monarchy to be decided at a later date. Three regents\u2014Sr\u0111an Budisavljevi\u0107, a Serb; Ante Mandi\u0107, a Croat; and Du\u0161an Sernec, a Slovene\u2014were sworn in at Belgrade on 3 March 1945. They appointed the new government, to be headed by Tito as prime minister and minister of war, with \u0160uba\u0161i\u0107 as foreign minister, on 7 March. On 29 November 1945, while still in exile, King Peter II was deposed by the constituent assembly. The Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia was internationally recognized as Yugoslavia and Peter II became a pretender. Until 1929, Serbs, Croats and Slovenes were the constitutional nations, when they were merged into a single \"Yugoslav\" nationality. Serbo-Croatian: 8,911,509 (74. Slovene: 1,019,997 (8.

The Kingdom had three universities: the University of Belgrade, University of Zagreb and the University of Ljubljana, located in what were then the most developed cities in the country. The subdivisions of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia existed successively in three different forms. From 1918 to 1922, the kingdom maintained the pre\u2013World War I subdivisions of Yugoslavia's predecessor states. In 1922, the state was divided into thirty-three oblasts (provinces). In 1929, after the establishment of the January 6 Dictatorship, a new system of nine banovinas (regions) was implemented by royal decree. In 1939, as an accommodation to Yugoslav Croats in the Cvetkovi\u0107-Ma\u010dek Agreement, a single Banovina of Croatia was formed from two of these banovinas (and from sections of others). The most popular sport in the Kingdom was association football. The Yugoslav Football Association was founded in Zagreb in 1919. It was based in Zagreb until the 6 January Dictatorship, when the association was moved to Belgrade. From 1923, a national championship was held annually. The national team played its first match at the 1920 Summer Olympics. It also participated in the inaugural FIFA World Cup, finishing fourth. Other popular sports included water polo, which was dominated nationally by the Croatian side VK Jug. The Kingdom participated at the Olympic Games from 1920 until 1936. During this time, the country won eight medals, all in gymnastics and six of these were won by Leon \u0160tukelj, a Slovene who was the most nominated gymnast of that time.\n",

The building continues to serve county functions; it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. The courthouse is located at the southeast corner of Court and High Streets, just north of Skowhegan's central business district. A modern court building, housing the local district court, stands across High Street to the north. The original 1873 portion of the building, oriented west toward Court Street, is a three-story brick structure with stone trim. It has a truncated hip roof that once sported a cupola (removed during the 1904 alterations), with a cornice that has heavy brackets. The front and sides each have slightly projecting central sections marked by corner brick pilasters, that in front topped by a gable roof. A single-story gable-roofed portico shelters the main entrance, supported by groups of chamfered granite posts. The upper two levels have windows set in tall round-arch openings. To the rear of this main block stands a 1938 addition, two stories in height. Its entrance on the north side repeats details found in the main entrance, and the second-floor windows are also set in round-arch openings, not as elaborate as those of the original building. Brick pilasters and corbelling at the eave are also features repeated in the addition from the main block. Somerset County was incorporated in 1809 from parts of Kennebec County, with its original county seat at Norridgewock. In 1872 the county seat was formally relocated to Skowhegan, provided that town could provide adequate space for county functions in a timely manner. Temporary space was deemed by the county commissioners to be inadequate, and a legal struggle ensued between the towns over the matter. This was resolved when former Governor of Maine Abner Coburn, a Skowhegan native and one of the state's wealthiest men, offered to pay for the construction of a courthouse in his hometown. The original portion of the main block was designed by local architect Charles F. Douglas, and was completed in 1873. In 1904 the noted Portland architect John Calvin Stevens oversaw a renovation and expansion of the building, in which two bays were added to the rear, matching in style Douglas' design, with a complete redesign of the interior. The building was then enlarged again in 1938.\n",

        "reference": ". She worked for the United States Geological Survey and NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. She was the last project manager of NASA's Galileo mission to Jupiter and until the time of her death had served as project manager and scientist of NASA's role in the European-led Rosetta mission to study Comet Churyumov\u2013Gerasimenko. Alexander was born in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. Alexander's mother was Gaynelle Justena Williams Alexander (1929-2017), a corporate librarian for Intel. Alexander's father was Harold Alfred Alexander (1917-2010), a social worker. Alexander's siblings are Suzanne and David. Alexander was raised by her mother in Santa Clara, California. Alexander wanted to be a journalist but her parents\u2014who were paying for her education\u2014wanted her to become an engineer. After a summer job at the Ames Research Center, she became interested in planetary science. Although she had been hired to work in the engineering section, she would sneak off to the science section where she found that not only was she good at the work, but that it was easier and more enjoyable to her than she had expected. In 1983 Alexander received a Bachelor's degree from the University of California, Berkeley in geophysics, which she thought would be a good background for a planetary scientist. Alexander earned her Master's from the University of California, Los Angeles in geophysics and space physics in 1985. Her masters' thesis used Pioneer Venus Orbiter data to study solar cycle variations in extreme ultraviolet radiation of the Venus ionosphere and its interaction with the solar wind. She earned her Ph.D. in Atmospheric, Oceanic and Space Sciences, specializing in the physics of space plasma, from the University of Michigan in 1993. Alexander worked at the United States Geological Survey studying plate tectonics and the Ames Research Center observing Jovian moons, before moving to NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in 1986. She worked as science coordinator for the plasma wave instrument aboard the Galileo spacecraft before becoming the project manager of the mission in its final phase. The mission discovered 21 new moons of Jupiter and the presence of an atmosphere on Ganymede. The discovery of the atmosphere, more precisely a \"surface bound exosphere\", caused scientists to rethink their assumptions that Ganymede was inactive moon. She was the final project manager for the mission, and oversaw the spacecraft's dive into Jupiter's atmosphere at the mission's conclusion in 2003. Alexander worked as a researcher on diverse topics, including: the evolution and interior physics of comets, Jupiter and its moons, magnetospheres, plate tectonics, space plasma, the discontinuities and expansion of solar wind, and the planet Venus. She also worked with the project team as a science coordinator on the Cassini mission to Saturn. She wrote or co-authored fourteen papers. She was a strong advocate for women and minorities in the STEM fields and a passionate science communicator. In April 2015, she presented a TEDx talk at Columbia College Chicago, entitled \"The Compelling Nature of Locomotion and the Strange Case of Childhood Education\", demonstrating her approach for educating children about science. She also mentored young people, particularly young girls of color, to encourage their passions for science. From 2000 until the time of her death, Alexander served as project scientist of NASA's role in Rosetta, the European Space Agency mission to study and land on comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. On the mission she was responsible for $35 million in instrumentation, collecting data such as temperature from three instruments on the orbiter. She also oversaw tracking and navigation support from the NASA's Deep Space Network for the spacecraft. In addition to her scientific work, Alexander had a passion for writing. She wrote children's books, including some of the \"Windows to Adventure\" series, \"Which of the Mountains Is Greatest of All\"? and \"Windows to the Morning Star\". She also wrote science fiction and was a member of the Romance Writers of America. Additionally, she used her writing skills to contribute to another one of her passions, tennis, and wrote for the Bleacher Report tennis blog. She also enjoyed traveling and horseback riding. The year of her graduation from the University of Michigan she was named \"U-M Woman of the Year in Human Relations\", and in 2002 she earned the Atmospheric, Oceanic and Space Sciences Alumni Merit Award. In 2003, Alexander was awarded the Emerald Honor for Women of Color in Research & Engineering by Career Communications Group, Inc.\u2014publisher of Black Engineer & Information Technology Magazine\u2014at the National Women of Color Research Sciences and Technology Conference. The Claudia Alexander Scholarship was established for undergraduate students at her alma mater in 2007 by her uncle, Jiles Williams. The scholarship supports need-based students majoring in Climate and Space Sciences and Engineering in the University of Michigan's College of Engineering. Alexander was a member of the American Geophysical Union\u2014where she served as chair of the diversity subcommittee\u2014 and the Association for Women Geoscientists, where she was named \"Woman of the Year\". In 2015 scientists from the European Space Agency's Rosetta mission honored their deceased colleague by naming a feature after her on the mission's target, comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. A gate-like feature on the comet has been named C. Alexander Gate. On July 11, 2015, Alexander died in Arcadia, California after a 10-year battle with breast cancer. Alexander is buried at Oak Hill Memorial Park in San Jose, California. She is dedicated in the Disney Junior television show,\u201cMiles from Tomorrowland\u201d, in the Season 1 episode,\u201dA Growing Problem & The Tardigrade Escapade\u201d.\n",

        "prefix": "\"Kiss Me\" is a song recorded by American pop rock band Sixpence None the Richer from their 1997 self-titled album. Released as",
        "reference": " a single in August 1998, the song was a worldwide success. It reached No. 4 on the UK and New Zealand singles charts as well as No. 1 on the Australian and Canadian singles chart, making it the group's highest-charting single worldwide. \"Kiss Me\" is also the group's best-selling single in the United States, peaking at No. 2 and spending 16 weeks in the top 10 and 35 weeks on the chart altogether. At the end of 1999, Billboard ranked the song as the sixth best-selling single of 1999. \"Kiss Me\" was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals. Rick Anderson of AllMusic described the song as \"an utterly irresistible slice of swoony guitar pop\" adding that \"is impossible to shake loose from the brain and could well turn out to be this generation's 'I Wanna Hold Your Hand'\". The original music video, also directed by album/single producer Steve Taylor, pays tribute to French filmmaker Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut and his film Jules et Jim, made in black and white and recreating many of the classic scenes from the film. Two alternate versions of the video were also released later, which featured the band sitting on a park bench, performing and watching scenes from either She's All That or Dawson's Creek on a portable television or projected on an outdoor screen. Freddie Prinze Jr. and Rachael Leigh Cook appeared in the She's All That version of the video. The Dawson's Creek version of the video became VH1's number-one video for the entire month of May 1999. New Found Glory's music video revolves around a large group of teenagers who construct a tree house out of mattresses, and throw a raucous garden party involving pillow fights and kissing, while the members of the band, along with the members of Paramore perform the song around them. While the bands perform, a young man, played by drummer Chase Dodds of the band Classic Addict, sets off on a mission to kiss as many girls as possible during the party, keeping a tally on his inner left forearm in black pen. After narrowly avoiding kissing a man (whom he mistakes for a girl because of his long hair), Chase attempts to kiss Paramore's lead singer, Hayley Williams, only to have her recognize the tally on his arm, and slap him in the face, knocking him to the ground. He is then set upon by all the girls he has kissed at the party, who then proceed to strip him of his shirt, and tie him to a nearby tree with duct tape. One of the girls tapes his mouth shut, before writing \"kiss me\" on his chest in black pen. The girls then rejoin the party, leaving Chase tied to the tree. In this version, to make it more suitable to be sung from a male point of view, the line \"You'll wear those shoes and I will wear that dress\" is changed to \"I'll wear those shoes and you will wear that dress\". \"Kiss Me\" as performed by Debbie Scott was featured in the Music and Rhythm Game Pump It Up: Exceed, which included a music video of a young girl and her pet cat. The song has been covered by Avril Lavigne, Katie Melua, UK R&B singer Nathan, Lava Lava on their album \"Tour Demo\", and New Found Glory on their album From the Screen to Your Stereo Part II. The New Found Glory version has been released as a single with a music video. It has also been covered by Singaporean Olivia Ong on her album A Girl Meets Bossa Nova 2, and by American Jewel. A cover by Debbie Scott appeared in the game Pump It Up: Exceed. A cover of the song was put in the game Karaoke Revolution. The song was covered on the eighth series of The X Factor by Janet Devlin in Week 7. Three months after the debut release of the single, The WB's popular teen drama Dawson's Creek played \"Kiss Me\" as background music in two of its episodes, \"The Dance\" and \"The Perfect Wedding\". The song was included on the first soundtrack on Songs from Dawson's Creek, released on April 27, 1999, which made No. 7 on the album charts. In January 1999, Miramax used \"Kiss Me\" as the main theme song of its teen romantic comedy film She's All That. The film's box office success helped \"Kiss Me\" to gain widespread mainstream attention and chart success. \"Kiss Me\" climbed to No. 2 on [[Billboard Hot 100|Billboard'''s Hot 100]] list, and stayed in the Top 10 for 16 straight weeks. In Italy the film was retitled \"Kiss Me\". In June 1999, BBC Television in the United Kingdom used the song as a closing theme for the BBC One broadcast coverage of Prince Edward's royal wedding. The song was part of the official soundtrack for the 2001 comedy film Not Another Teen Movie which used the song in a scene parodying a scene from She's All That. The song was also featured in the film How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days and in the episode \"Simprovised\" of Fox animated series The Simpsons. In an interview with Vogue'', Taylor Swift said that \"Kiss Me\" was the very first song that she learned to play on guitar when she was 12 years old.\n",

Shimmin started his career, spending six years at Highbury playing for the various youth teams at Arsenal under Ars\u00e8ne Wenger. After leaving the Gunners, Shimmin made the move across the city to Queens Park Rangers, with whom he played from 2005 until January 2008. The deal was for a small nominal fee at first, with up to \u00a380,000 in add-ons, dependent on appearances. Shimmin made his d\u00e9but against Coventry City in a 3\u20130 defeat, however a serious knee injury prevented him from playing many games for QPR. During this time Shimmin had a loan spell at Bournemouth where he only managed 2 league games due to injury. Prior to that he was a youth player with Arsenal until 2004. QPR announced that Shimmin's contract had been cancelled by mutual consent on 28 January 2008. On 8 February 2008, Shimmin joined Crawley Town on a short-term deal. He was released in March, after failing to overcome a hamstring injury. He impressed whilst at Crawley and it was with a heavy heart that the Red Devils were forced to release him. In July 2008, Shimmin joined St Mirren on trial, but signed for Greenock Morton soon afterwards. Shimmin made his Morton d\u00e9but in a Co-operative Insurance Cup tie at Stair Park, in which Morton won 6\u20133 against the home side Stranraer to progress to the second round where Morton would dispose of SPL side Hibernian in a seven-goal thriller. He made his first league appearance for Morton in a 2\u20132 draw with St Johnstone at Cappielow on 8 August 2008. Shimmin was named Irn-Bru Phenomenal Young Player of the Month for October 2008, after helping Morton to rally after a poor start to the season. Shimmin spent nine months out 'injured', from March 2009, making a return on the bench for the Scottish Cup game at Dumbarton on 5 December. He was released by Morton at the end of the 2009\u201310 season. Shimmin, as of 27 May 2010 has signed a two-year contract at Dundee.

He earned a B.S. from the University of Illinois in 1940 and a Ph.D. from New York University in 1944. Hansch worked on the Manhattan Project at the University of Chicago and as a group leader at DuPont Nemours in Richland, Washington. In February 1946 he received an academic position at Pomona College. Hansch taught Organic Chemistry for many years at Pomona College, and was known for giving complex lectures without using notes. His course in Physical Bio-Organic Medicinal Chemistry was ground-breaking at an undergraduate level. Hansch may be best known as the father of the concept of quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR), the quantitative correlation of the physicochemical properties of molecules with their biological activities. Multivariate Statistics - Multivariate statistics is  a set of statistical tools to analyse data (e.g., chemical and biological) matrices using regression and/or pattern recognition techniques. Hansch Analysis - Hansch analysis is the investigation of the quantitative relationship between the biological activity of a series of compounds and their physicochemical substituent or global parameters representing hydrophobic, electronic, steric and other effects using multiple regression correlation methodology. Hansch-Fujita  constant - The Hansch-Fujita  constant describes the contribution of a substituent to the lipophilicity of a compound. Organic Chemistry; Interaction of organic chemicals with living organisms, Quantitative Structure Activity Relationships (QSAR). He died of pneumonia on May 8, 2011 in Claremont, California at 92. His research group at Pomona College worked on QSAR studies and in building and expanding the database of chemical and physical data as C-QSAR and Bioloom. His postgraduate associates were Rajni Garg, Cynthia D Selassie, Suresh Babu Mekapati, and Alka Kurup. The Journal of Computer-Aided Molecular Design carried four obituaries (as found in a Pubmed personal subject [ps] search). Among his students at Pomona was Jennifer Doudna. Doudna has credited Hansch as an influence. Books: WorldCat shows \"53 works in 204 publications in 4 languages and 2,004 library holdings\" for Hansch as \"author, editor, other\".

        "reference": "), Sweden and the sole Nordic host of a Formula One World Championship Grand Prix, when the Swedish Grand Prix was held for six years between 1973 and 1978. The track was built on marshlands in 1968 and became an extremely popular venue in the 1970s, just as Swede Ronnie Peterson was at the height of his career. It has a long straight (called Flight Straight, which was also used as a  aircraft runway ), as well as several banked corners, making car setup an engineering compromise. Unusually, the pit lane is located halfway round the lap. The raceway hosted six Formula One Swedish Grand Prix events in the 1970s. When Peterson and Gunnar Nilsson died during the 1978 Formula One season, public support for the event dried up and the Swedish Grand Prix came to an end. The circuit is also noteworthy because it was the site of the first and only win of two unconventional F1 cars: the six-wheeled Tyrrell P34 car in 1976 and the infamous Brabham 'fan car' in 1978. Anderstorp also hosted the Swedish motorcycle Grand Prix in 1971\u20131977 and 1981\u20131990, the European Touring Car Championship in 1985\u20131987, the Superbike World Championship in 1991 and 1993, and the FIA GT Championship in 2002 and 2003. The circuit has been a popular car club venue since the 1990s. The FIA World Touring Car Championship (WTCC) returned to Anderstorp in 2007, replacing the Istanbul Park in Turkey on the WTCC calendar. For the 2008 season however, it was replaced by the Imola circuit. International motorsport will return to Anderstorp in 2020 with a round of the DTM. The circuit has been modified at least twice in its history. It had been modified before the final Formula One Grand Prix run on the circuit (1978 Swedish Grand Prix), with the modifications to the penultimate Norra corner, which resulted in the length increase from 4. 018\u00a0km to 4. 031\u00a0km, and it remained in that configuration until at least 1986. And then it was later modified again and slightly shortened to its present-day length of 4. 025\u00a0km. 018\u00a0km \u2013 1968? 031\u00a0km \u2013 1978 \u2013? 025\u00a0km \u2013? Contrary to common depiction of the 1978 modification as having a chicane introduced to the Norra corner, there was no chicane ever used: the corner was made slower by decreasing its radius and making it a sharper bend instead of a sweeping curve it was before.\n",

        "reference": " include peace and anti-war, human rights and Arab- and Muslim-Americans groups. Their tactics include education, protest, civil disobedience and lobbying. Political activism against occupation first emerged in the wake of the Six-Day War when Israel conquered the West Bank, Gaza and the Golan Heights from Jordan, Egypt, and Syria. The American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee (ADC), founded in by U.S. Senator James Abourezk in 1980, calls the Israeli occupation of Palestinian land the \"foremost obstacle to peace\". The American Task Force on Palestine (ATFP) seeks an end to the occupation through negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians, anchored in international law. It believes this to be in the national interest of Americans, Palestinians and Israelis. Its work is focused on \"the effort to create this critical mass for ending the occupation\". The Arab American Institute (AAI), founded in 1985 by James Zogby, lobbies for an end to Israeli settlements, protests what it sees as human rights violations in the West Bank and Gaza, and supports the two-state solution. The Palestine Center's purpose is to bring together the American and Palestinian communities to learn about the Palestinian people's quest for sovereignty, civil and political rights and an end to Israeli occupation of East Jerusalem, the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, the surrounding refugee camps. The Muslim Public Affairs Council (MPAC) notes that despite U.N. resolutions, Israel continues to expand its settlements. It calls for dialogue and diplomacy to end the conflict. The Palestinian American Congress (PAC), founded in 1995, \"adheres to the principles that the Palestinian people constitute an indivisible National Unit and that Palestine is its national homeland\". It asserts that according to international law Palestinian land cannot be annexed as long as \"the occupied people are still resisting the occupation\". The Washington Report on Middle East Affairs publishes numerous articles about the occupation and keeps a running log of U.S. aid to Israel which supports that occupation. The Council for the National Interest (CNI) opposes Israel's occupation of Palestinian lands since the Six Day war. The Mennonite Central Committee (MCC) looks for economic means to end the occupation of what it calls \"Palestine/Israel\". It suggests an economic boycott by all Christians of Israel, including divestment of stocks of companies that do business with Israel. MCC activist Alain Weaver has advocated a One-state solution, writing \"Might not a bi-national future in one state be one in which Palestinians and Israelis alike both sit securely under vine and fig tree\"? The American Friends Service Committee (AFSC) opposes settlements in the occupied territories. In December, 2008, AFSC wrote an open letter to President Obama, urging American pressure to stop the war in Gaza and to open negotiations with Hamas. As a quaker organization that opposes all war, AFSC has been active in Israel and Palestine, supporting pacifism, conscientious objectors, and nonviolence. In 2004 the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.), which had long opposed the occupation of Palestine, called for a \"phased selective divestment in accordance with General Assembly policy on social investing\". Michael Lewis, director of Policy Analysis for the American Israel Public Affairs Committee criticizes a number of anti-occupation groups, contending that their goals are \"to drive a wedge between the U.S. government and Israel; to undermine public and government support for Israel in the United States, and (especially since the 1973 war) to bring about a halt in American governmental aid to Israel\". In his book In the Trenches: Selected Speeches and Writings of an American Jewish Activist, David A. Harris, executive director of the American Jewish Committee says Israel must explain \"how the occupation came about\" and dismisses as \"buzzwords\" Palestinians attempts to gain sympathy as an occupied people.\n",

        "prefix": "State Route 89 (SR 89) is a state highway in the U.S. state of California that travels in the north\u2013south direction, serving as a",
        "reference": " major thoroughfare for many mountain communities in the Sierra Nevada and the Cascade Range. It starts from U.S. Route 395 near Topaz Lake, winding its way up to the  Monitor Pass, down to the Carson River, and up again over the  Luther Pass. From that point on, the route generally loses elevation on its way past Lake Tahoe, through Tahoe and Plumas National Forests until Lake Almanor. For roughly nine miles the route is then a part of State Route 36. The route then ascends to the  Morgan Summit. After it enters Lassen Volcanic National Park it continues to gain elevation until it reaches its highest point in an unnamed pass in the middle of Lassen Peak and Bumpass Mountain. The road then descends and heads northwest, finally terminating at Interstate 5 at the foot of Mount Shasta at around. SR 89 begins at an intersection with US 395. The highway goes west through a few switchbacks before crossing into Alpine County and the Humboldt-Toiyabe National Forest. The southernmost section of State Route 89 over Monitor Pass is also closed in winter due to snow accumulation. SR 89 continues by Heenan Lake before intersecting with the eastern end of SR 4 and turning northwest, passing through Markleeville. SR 89 continues northwest to the town of Woodfords, where it turns west, running concurrently with SR 88 for a brief distance before turning into El Dorado County. The section of SR 89 from SR 88 north to US 50 is co-signed as US 50 Alternate for use as a detour for when US 50 closes. The highway continues north to Meyers, where it runs concurrently with US 50 into the city of South Lake Tahoe. SR 89 continues along the western shore of Lake Tahoe, where it passes through Camp Richardson, Emerald Bay, Meeks Bay, Pomins, and Tahoma. After crossing into Placer County, SR 89 passes through Chambers Lodge, Homewood, Tahoe Pines, Skyland, Timberland, Pineland, and Tahoe Tavern before coming to an intersection with SR 28, where SR 89 continues to the west, away from the lake. The road curves to the north through Tahoe National Forest before crossing into Nevada County and the city of Truckee. This portion of the highway has been designated the \"10th Mountain Division Memorial Highway\", honoring the US Army division that lost 992 soldiers during the Italian Campaign in World War II. SR 89 runs concurrently with I-80 eastbound briefly before exiting to the north and continuing through the city of Truckee and passing near Prosser Creek Reservoir outside of the city limits. SR 89 continues through Hobart Mills before crossing into Sierra County and continuing northwest to Randolph and Sierraville, where it shares a wrong-way concurrency with SR 49 through the town of Sattley; they then intersect CR A23 before SR 89 splits off to the northwest. SR 89 continues through Calpine before crossing into Plumas County. SR 89 continues through Clio and Graeagle before running concurrently with SR 70 through Plumas National Forest, passing through Blairsden, Feather River Inn, Cromberg, Spring Garden, Massack (where SR 70 and 89 have a rest area), East Quincy, and the city of Quincy. SR 70 and SR 89 continue north through Keddie before SR 89 splits off to the north and passes through Indian Falls, Crescent Mills, Greenville, and Canyondam. The section of SR 89 from SR 70 north to Crescent Mills was built over the abandoned railway bed of the Indian Valley Railroad. SR 89 intersects with the south end of SR 147 before paralleling the southern shore of Lake Almanor and running concurrently with SR 36 westbound, crossing into Tehama County and Lassen National Forest. SR 36 and SR 89 intersect the northern terminus of SR 32 and SR 172 before SR 36 splits off to the west and SR 89 enters Lassen Volcanic National Park. The SR 89 designation does not run through the national park. The continuation of SR 89 that runs through Lassen Volcanic National Park is closed in winter due to very heavy snowfall and snowpack. When it is open, a park fee is charged. At the other park entrance in the northwest corner in Shasta County, one can continue along SR 44 to the northeast. SR 89 continues north from SR 44 through Hat Creek and Doyles Corner before intersecting SR 299. The highway passes through Four Corners and Cayton before intersecting CR A19 and crossing into Siskiyou County. SR 89 briefly passes through the Klamath National Forest and Bartle and McCloud before coming to an interchange with I-5. SR 89 then merges with Mount Shasta Boulevard and terminates just outside the Mount Shasta City city limits. One point of interest along California State Route 89 includes the Pony Express remount station in Woodfords, the Lake Tahoe Outlet Gates in Tahoe City (control of these gates was the source of the two-decade \"Tahoe Water War\" between lakeshore owners and downstream Truckee River water users), Plumas-Eureka State Park (containing Johnsville, a well-preserved '49er town, and Pioneer Ski Area, the first sport skiing area in the Western hemisphere), Lake Almanor and Lassen Volcanic National Park. Many other points of interest, including Brokeoff Mountain, Sulphur Works, Emerald Lake, Lake Helen, Bumpass Hell, Lassen Peak and Summit Lake are also located on this highway. SR 89 is part of the California Freeway and Expressway System, and north of the southern SR 44 junction is part of the National Highway System, a network of highways that are considered essential to the country's economy, defense, and mobility by the Federal Highway Administration. SR 89 is eligible for the State Scenic Highway System; however, it is only a scenic highway as designated by Caltrans from the El Dorado-Placer county line to a point 3. 2 miles west of the US 395 junction, meaning that it is a substantial section of highway passing through a \"memorable landscape\" with no \"visual intrusions\", where the potential designation has gained popular favor with the community. From the junction with SR 147, through the park and including the gap on SR 44, to its terminus at I-5, SR 89 is part of the Volcanic Legacy Scenic Byway, a National Scenic Byway. The segment of SR 89 from I-80 in Truckee to SR 49 through Sattley also forms part of the Yuba-Donner Scenic Byway, a National Forest Scenic Byway.\n",

        "reference": " Administration, Master of Public Administration, Master of Public Health, Education Specialist, Doctor of Education, Doctor of Business Administration, and Doctor of Philosophy degrees. Walden is a part of a global network of universities managed by Laureate Education Inc. The university's academic offices are in Minneapolis, Minnesota and its administrative offices are in Baltimore, Maryland. Walden was established in 1970 by two New York teachers, Bernie and Rita Turner, who created a program for working adults/teachers to pursue doctoral degrees. In the summer of 1971, the first classes took place in Naples, Florida, focusing primarily on school administrators. The initial classes allowed students to form dissertation topics with their faculty partners before returning to work at their respective schools while completing their dissertations. In 1972, Walden conferred its first degrees: 46 PhDs and 24 EdDs at its first commencement in Naples. In 1979, the Minnesota Higher Education Coordinating Board licensed Walden to grant PhDs and EdDs in the state and in 1982 the school moved its headquarters to Minneapolis. In 1990, the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools accredited the University. In 1995, the school expanded its offering with the nation's first fully online master's program in education, offering a Master's in Educational Change and Technology Innovation. Sylvan Learning Systems, Inc., purchased 41 percent of Walden University in 2001, gaining a controlling interest in 2002. In 2004, Sylvan Learning Systems became Laureate Education, Inc. Former US President Bill Clinton was an Honorary Chancellor of Laureate International Universities from 2010 to 2015. President Clinton was the keynote speaker at Walden University's commencement on July 30, 2011. Jonathan Kaplan served as CEO from 2007 to 2018. Mr. Kaplan previously served three years as economic policy adviser to President Clinton. In 2013, Laureate Education Inc. and GSV Capital, IFC, Learn Capital and Yuri Milner provided $43M in funding to Coursera to expand online education. In 2015, Ernesto Zedillo, former president of Mexico and director of the Yale University Center for the Study of Globalization, succeeded President Clinton as Laureate Education's Presidential Counselor. In 2016, Looney and Yannelis (Brookings Institution) reported that Walden University student loan debt was the second highest in the US, with 120,275 students owing 9. 833 billion dollars. While the 5-year student default rate was low (7 percent), the percentage of balance repaid on the loans was 0 percent. According to The Journal of Blacks in Higher Education, Walden University graduated the largest number of African American doctoral students from 2011-2015. From 2013 to 2017, the number of doctorates \"awarded to Blacks\" from Walden University was 969, more than two and a half times the number conferred by Howard University, which awarded 344 doctorates during the same period. In 2019, Laureate Education Inc. contemplated selling off the school. Dr. Ward Ulmer serves as president of Walden University. Dr. Ulmer was previously senior vice provost for Strayer University. Paula Singer serves as the CEO. Walden University receives more than 75% of its funds from the US government, including more than $750 million a year for graduate student loans, the largest amount for any US college. Walden University has been under heightened cash monitoring from the US Department of Education since 2016. On April 8, 2016, the Minnesota Office of Higher Education notified Walden University that its renewal application to participate in the State Authorization Reciprocity Agreements (SARA) was rejected because Walden University did not have a US Department of Education financial composite score of 1. 5 or higher. In 2018, Brookings Institution reported that Walden's graduate 5-year student loan repayment rate was 13 percent. Walden University is regionally accredited by the Higher Learning Commission. Walden's PhD in Counselor Education and Supervision; MS in Marriage, Couple, and Family Counseling; and MS in Clinical Mental Health Counseling programs are accredited by the Council for Accreditation of Counseling and Related Educational Programs (CACREP). Walden University's Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP), Master of Science in Nursing (MSN), and Bachelor of Science in Nursing programs are all accredited by the Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education (CCNE), a national accrediting agency recognized by the U.S. Department of Education and the Council for Higher Education Accreditation. Walden University's BS in Business Administration, Master of Business Administration (MBA), Executive MBA, Doctor of Business Administration (DBA), and PhD in Management programs are accredited by the Accreditation Council for Business Schools and Programs (ACBSP). Walden's MS in Project Management program is accredited by the PMI Global Accreditation Center (GAC) for Project Management Education Programs. Walden's Masters of Social Work is Council of Social Workers Education (CSWE) accredited, an accreditation needed to get licensed as a social worker in most states. Walden's BS in Information Technology is one of only a few online programs accredited by ABET, the internationally recognized accreditor for college and university programs in applied science, computing, engineering, and engineering technology. Walden University is designated as a National Center of Academic Excellence in Cyber Defense Education by the National Security Agency and the Department of Homeland Security. Walden University's PhD specializations in Clinical Psychology and Counseling Psychology are not accredited by the American Psychological Association (APA) and have not received designation by the Association of State and Provincial Psychology Boards/National Register (ASPPB/NR), which are requirements for licensure in some states. The MS and six other PhD in psychology specializations offered by Walden are not governed by APA. Richard W. Riley College of Education and Leadership: The Riley College of Education has graduated more than 28,000 educators and currently enrolls over 16,000 students from all 50 states. According to College Navigator, Walden University has 204 full-time instructors and 2,821 part-time instructors. Walden's 3-year student loan cohort default rate (CDR) is 6. 8%; the national average is 11. 8% for all US institutions. A study by the American Institutes for Research (AIR) found that the average annual federal student loan amounts of Walden graduate degree borrowers is similar to the federal loan amounts of students at public and private non-profit institutions. 7 to 3 percent of Walden students defaulted on loans between 2005 and 2008. The average default rate at for-profit universities is 17. 1 to 22. 6 percent, and the average default rate for all US colleges is 8. 4 to 12. 3 percent. According to the US Department of Education's College Scorecard, Walden University has an 11 percent graduation rate, a 30 percent student loan repayment rate, and a median income of $50,100 after attending. Walden University and its parent company Laureate International Universities have been linked to former US Senator and Secretary of State (and Presidential candidate) Hillary Clinton, her husband, former US President Bill Clinton, and their Clinton Foundation. Daniel Runde formally debunked many insinuating claims made regarding the Clinton Foundation, Laureate Education, and the IYF. The World Bank currently has invested $150 million in Laureate Education, Walden University's parent company. Fact checkers at The Washington Post concurred, citing the claims as conflated and inaccurate. Fact checkers at PolitiFact.com also found the claims to be false. A story in the Sept 5, 2016 edition of The Washington Post also investigated Clinton's role with Laureate and found many of the political claims to be false. In October 2016, NBC News reported that the Minnesota Office of Higher Education was investigating a spike in student complaints. NBC News further reported that former students had filed a class action suit against the school for prolonging their enrollments for years, \"until they were left hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt and still short of a degree\".

        "reference": " American Express Company of New York (then a freight forwarding service). The entity was reformed as a joint stock trading company on June 1, 1869, with ownership divided among the Cleveland, Columbus, Cincinnati and Indianapolis Railway (CCC&I), the Lake Shore and Michigan Southern Railway, and the New York Central Railroad (NYC), all part of the Cornelius Vanderbilt rail empire. The MDT entered the refrigerated transit business around 1880, and within five years had 1,900 reefers in service, making it one of the largest such concerns in the United States. Historian and author John H. White describes MDT as \"the oldest corporate name connected with refrigerated transit to survive into modern times\". The company began manufacturing cars on a small scale in 1883, and in spring of 1887 constructed a large manufacturing facility near Rochester, New York in a town they named Despatch (present-day East Rochester). MDT hired 900 workers and embarked on an aggressive car building program; by 1900 the firm owned 6,687 units, slightly more than half of which were refrigerator cars. The East Rochester plant would grow in time to encompass some 64 acres (with an adjacent rail yard of equal size), and would produce on the order of 36 cars per day. The installation became the main car plant within the New York Central system. MDT adopted the Wickes Patent into its refrigerator car design. Even with its own substantial manufacturing capacity, MDT at times purchased rolling stock from outside companies such as Pullman in order to meet the demands imposed by its rapidly expanding shipping service. The company incorporated in the State of New York in May, 1911. 3,400 reefers were sold to the NYC in December 1912, and 2,988 to the Lake Shore line, though all of the units were in turn leased back to the MDT. The firm was reincorporated as a Delaware corporation in 1923. Circa 1925, the NYC established a new subsidiary, the Eastern Refrigerator Despatch (mirroring the expansion strategy of the rival Fruit Growers Express). Operation of the ERD, along with its 2,100 reefers, was quickly absorbed by Merchants Despatch. In November, 1928 the MDT purchased the Northern Refrigerator Car Line (founded by Milwaukee's Cudahy brothers) and its 1,800 cars. A holding company, Merchants Despatch, Inc., merged with the MDT in 1936; the new venture was chartered in Delaware on December 18. In 1962 the NRC was combined with Merchants Despatch. At the same time, greater emphasis was placed on auto carrier business; from 1961 to 1966, the company acquired nearly 1,200 autorack cars (although the base flatcars were owned by MDT, the rack structures were owned by the New York Central). MDT also entered the Intermodal freight transport business, and purchased 572 Flexi-Van container flats (intended mainly for use in mail service on passenger trains) between 1958 and 1965. As part of the consolidation of facilities planned for the Penn Central merger, the car shop was closed down on April 1, 1970, and the 72-acre property was sold off. In July, 1985 the MDT assumed the responsibility for car weighing and inspection previously under the purview of the Eastern Weighing and Inspection Bureau. After ceasing construction, MDT would continue as a repair shop, and a car lessor to both railroad and private companies. As an independent lessor, it was able to outlast NYCs merger into Penn Central, and their collapse into Conrail. However, after the 1998 purchase of Conrail, MDT's assets were merged and the company dissolved in 2000. Source: The Great Yellow Fleet, p. 16.\n",

Overall, the title has been possessed by seventy-five different wrestlers throughout the title's existence. The first champion was Jos\u00e9 Miguel P\u00e9rez, who was billed as champion upon the title's creation. He also holds the longest reign, at 426 days. Invader I holds the record for most reigns at 12. The belt and its design has been changed several times for a number of reasons. The location represented in the title's name has changed twice, both times in unofficial fashion after being rechristened and modified by its current holder in under to sell a villainous persona. During Fidel Sierra's second reign, which began on June 2, 2001, and lasted for three months, he defended the title under the name of \"Cuba Heavyweight Championship\". To illustrate this change, he covered the word \"Puerto Rico\" in the main banner with a sticker that was inscribed with the word \"Cuba\", also covering the map of Puerto Rico that was featured in the center of the plate with a sticker of the flag of Cuba. Sierra also covered the side plates with photos of him and his manager, Fantasy. All of these changes were reverted as soon as he lost the title. After winning the title on September 10, 2005, Brent Dail defended it as the \"51st State Championship\", a reference to the statehood movement and its intention to annex Puerto Rico as the 51st state of the United States. Like Sierra, he covered the main banner with a sticker inscribed with \"51st State\" and flanked the main plate with additional stickers featuring the acronym \"USA\".

In the common parlance, the term \"arbitrary long\" is often used in the context of sequence of numbers. For example, to say that there are \"arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions of prime numbers\" does not mean that there exists any infinitely long arithmetic progression of prime numbers (there is not), nor that there exists any particular arithmetic progression of prime numbers that is in some sense \"arbitrarily long\". Rather, the phrase is used to refer to the fact that no matter how large a number  is, there exists some arithmetic progression of prime numbers of length at least. However small a number, there will be a number  smaller than it such that  holds. Arbitrarily large vs. sufficiently large vs. While similar, \"arbitrarily large\" is not equivalent to \"sufficiently large\". For instance, while it is true that prime numbers can be arbitrarily large (since there are infinitely many of them due to Euclid's theorem), it is not true that all sufficiently large numbers are prime. As another example, the statement \" is non-negative for arbitrarily large \". Furthermore, \"arbitrarily large\" also does not mean \"infinitely large\". For example, although prime numbers can be arbitrarily large, an infinitely large prime number does not exist\u2014since all prime numbers (as well as all other integers) are finite.

In these cases, the phrase \"arbitrarily large\" does not have the meaning indicated above (i.e., \"however large a number, there will be some larger number for which  still holds\".

        "prefix": "Dubreuillosaurus is a genus of carnivorous dinosaur from the middle Jurassic Period. It is a megalosaurid theropod. Its fossils",
        "reference": " were found in France. The only named species, Dubreuillosaurus valesdunensis, was originally described as a species of Poekilopleuron, Poekilopleuron? valesdunensis, which is still formally the type species of the genus. It was later renamed Dubreuillosaurus valesdunensis when, in 2005, Allain came to the conclusion that it was not part of the genus Poekilopleuron. Its type specimen, MNHN 1998-13, is only rivalled in the number of preserved elements in this group by that of Eustreptospondylus. Dubreuillosaurus is considered to be the sister species of Magnosaurus. It did not show signs of insular dwarfism even though it was uncovered on an island. In 1994, the mayor of Conteville in Normandy, Andr\u00e9 Dubreuil, noted that during land rehabilitation of the old quarry of Pierre de Caen, dinosaur bones had surfaced. He secured a partial skull and some ribs and notified the Paris Mus\u00e9um national d'Histoire naturelle. However, professional excavations only started in 1998 when the rock of the collapsed quarry face had already been spread by a bulldozer over a considerable surface. It proved necessary to dig up and sieve many cubic metres of rubble over several years, ultimately salvaging about two thousand bone fragments, varying in size between one and ten centimetres. From these scraps a more complete skeleton had to be reassembled. In 2002, when this process had not yet been completed, Ronan Allain, after having dedicated a thesis to it, named the find as a new species of Poekilopleuron: Poekilopleuron? valesdunensis. The specific name referred to the nearby ancient battlefield of the Battle of Val-\u00e8s-Dunes, where William the Conqueror had in 1046 defeated his enemies. The naming paper also contained a description of the skull. The question mark after the generic name already indicated the assignment to Poekilopleuron was tentative. By 2005, Allain had come to the conclusion that the new species was not part of Poekilopleuron. He therefore created the new genus name Dubreuillosaurus for this species, the name honouring the Dubreuil family. The type species of the genus is the original Poekilopleuron valesdunensis, the combinatio nova is Dubreuillosaurus valesdunensis. The 2005 paper also contained a description of the postcranial skeleton. The holotype, MNHN 1998-13, has been uncovered in a layer of the Calcaire de Caen dating from the middle Bathonian. It consists of a fragmentary skeleton with skull. Preserved parts include: the majority of the skull; the splenial and angular of the lower jaw, a natural mold of the surangular, two cervical vertebrae, cervical ribs, seven dorsals, ribs, gastralia, three sacrals, ten caudals, a chevron, a piece of the scapula, a claw of the hand, a partial thighbone, the upper part of a shinbone, a partial fibula, a fifth metatarsal and the first phalanx of the third toe. Considering the incompleteness of most other megalosaurids, this genus is exceptional in having a significant percentage of the skeleton been found. The type specimen of Dubreuillosaurus is in the number of preserved elements only rivalled in this group by that of Eustreptospondylus. The holotype represents a subadult individual. Dubreuillosaurus was physically comparable to Eustreptospondylus. The holotype was an individual by Gregory S. Paul estimated to measure  long and to weigh. However, this was a subadult; the adult length is uncertain, though it has been indicated as high as. In 2005, Allain established some distinctive traits. Dubreuillosaurus has an unusually low and long skull, with a length three times the height. In the upper corner of the front edge of the nasal branch of the maxilla, a kink is present, separating a convex curvature below from a concave curvature above. The descending branch of the postorbital has a U-shaped cross-section. The parietal bones are not visible in side view. The supratemporal fenestra has a straight inner edge. A paraquadratic fenestra is lacking. A well-developed process is present on the underside of the jugal branch of the ectopterygoid. The rear edge of the jugal branch of the ectopterygoid, in front of the infratemporal fenestra, is deeply grooved. The lower jaw has a large external mandibular fenestra. The foramen mylohyoideum is largely oriented to the front and below. The head of the thighbone is directed to the inside and below. The front underside of the thighbone has a concave surface. In 2012 Matthew Carrano added one autapomorphy: on the rear of the braincase there is a notch between the basioccipital and the bone surface formed by the exoccipitals and the opisthotic. Dubreuillosaurus seemed to lack any sort of crest or horns, but the only known specimen is a juvenile, and it is possible that these structures developed in later life. Like its relatives, Dubreuillosaurus probably had short, powerful arms with three-fingered hands. Poekilopleuron? valesdunensis was in 2002 assigned to the Megalosauridae. In 2012 Carrano e.a. refined this to the Afrovenatorinae, in which clade it would be the sister species of Magnosaurus. During the Middle Jurassic much of Europe consisted of a number of islands. The fossil of Dubreuillosaurus was discovered in sedimentary rocks that were laid down in coastal, mangrove swamps at the east coast of the Armorican Massif. This suggests that it might have hunted fish and other marine prey. Allain in 2002 described P? valesdunensis as a fish eater or piscivore but this was influenced by the fact that the holotype of Poekilopleuron bucklandii had been found together with fish remains. Though uncovered at an island Dubreuillosaurus did not show the effects of insular dwarfism; like with Eustreptospondylus its small size is due to its being a subadult.\n",

        "prefix": "Waiofar, also spelled Waifar, Waifer or Waiffre (died 768), was the last independent Duke of Aquitaine from 7",
        "reference": "45 to 768. He peacefully succeeded his father, Hunald I, after the latter entered a monastery. He also inherited the conflict with the rising Carolingian family and its leader, Pepin the Short, who was king of the Franks after 751 and thus Waiofar's nominal suzerain. The beginning of open conflict between Waiofar and Pepin can be dated to 753, when the duke of Aquitaine granted asylum to Pepin's brother Grifo after the latter was forced to flee Francia because of his failed attempt at usurping the Duchy of Bavaria from its rightful lord. Pepin's immediate reaction is not recorded, but Grifo was subsequently assassinated while preparing to leave Aquitaine for Rome. In 751, according to the Chronicle of Moissac, Waiofar sacked the city of Narbonne (Narbonam depraedat), the centre of Islamic rule north of the Pyrenees, having been conquered by the Arabs in 720. The following year several other formerly Visigothic cities north of the Pyrenees, under a certain Count Ansemund, went over to the Franks. Between 752 and 759, Pepin's forces besieged Narbonne. For reasons unknown, Waiofar attacked Pepin's forces while they were camped by the city, \"as his father had attacked Charles Martel\" in the words of the Annals of Aniane. Only the local sources, the Chronicle of Moissac and Annals of Aniane, record this attack. Although the Chronicle of Uz\u00e8s records that the Rouergue was conquered by Pepin in 754, during the siege of Narbonne, it is more likely that its conquest was effected with the assistance of the local Visigoths only after the fall of Narbonne (a Gothic city prior to the Arab conquest). The Annals of Aniane and Chronicle of Moissac indicate that the Frankish army under Pepin began the conquest of southern Aquitaine immediately after the fall of Narbonne in 759, and by 760 Toulouse, Rodez (capital of the Rouergue) and Albi had fallen into their hands. In 760, Pepin denounced Waiofar's seizure of church lands and prepared to march against him. Ignoring the latter's request for peace, Pepin invaded Berry and the Auvergne and ravaged \"a large part of Aquitaine\" (maximam partem Aquitaniae). In 761, Waiofar responded by ordering Count Chunibert of Bourges and Count Blandinus of the Auvergne, his followers who controlled the northeastern borders of Aquitaine, to assemble their forces for an attack on Chalon-sur-Sa\u00f4ne. This army probably consisted mostly of local levies, since no Gascon (Basque) presence is mentioned. The Gascons (or Basques, Latin Vascones), whose presence the continuator of the Chronicle of Fredegar is otherwise scrupulous to record, were recruited from Gascony and served a professional core of Waiofar's army. In the ensuing campaign, Burgundy was ravaged, but Pepin pushed the invaders back and took the fortresses of Bourbon, Chantelle and Clermont in the Auvergne, forcing Count Blandinus to surrender. The garrison at Bourbon is described by the continuator of Fredegar as the \"men of Waiofar\" (homines Waiofarii). At the end of this campaign, Pepin obtained permanent control of many fortresses in the Auvergne by treaty. In 762, Pepin invaded Berry and Poitou. He captured Bourges, forcing the surrender of Count Chunibert, after a lengthy siege in which breastworks were erected around the city and ramparts constructed for putting siege weapons up to the walls. Thouars fell the same year, and the count of Poitiers made submission to Pepin. The Annales Laurissenses maiores record that many Gascons in the following of the counts of Bourges and Poitiers were captured and brought back to Neustria. In 762, Waiofar's cousin Count Mantio, with a Gascon levy, lay an ambush for a Carolingian force, either as it was entering or leaving Narbonne. His men dismounted and lay in wait, but in the subsequent battle they were routed. Mantio and his retinue were all killed and the Gascons fled on foot, with the Carolingians taking their horses as booty. In 763, Waiofar offered to submit to Pepin if he would receive Bourges and other Aquitainian cities in exchange for \"whatever tribute and gifts (tributa uel munera) Frankish kings had been accustomed to receive from the province of Aquitaine\". Nothing came of it. In 763, Pepin raided deep into Aquitaine as far as the Limousin and Quercy. In 764, Pepin held a Mayfeld, the Frankish annual assembly, in the city of Worms. Waiofar and Duke Tassilo III of Bavaria attended. According to the continuator of Fredegar, Waiofar opposed Pepin \"with a great army and many Vascones [Gascons] from across the Garonne, who in antiquity were called Vaceti [Basques]\" in 765. The \"great army\" and the \"large levy\" of Gascons may be distinct forces brought together for this campaign. In 764, Count Chilping of the Auvergne led such a dual force of local levies complemented by some Gascon soldiers taken from the garrison of Clermont. Between 763 and 766, Waiofar withdrew his garrisons from the cities (civitates) of Poitiers, Limoges, Saintes, P\u00e9rigueux and Angoul\u00eame. Most of these fortifications were restored after the cities were occupied by Pepin's forces. Archibald Lewis believes it was Pepin who destroyed the walls after he had conquered the cities if he judged he could not hold them. His interpretation is contradicted by Bernard Bachrach, who believes it was Waiofar who, before abandoning his cities, destroyed their defences and walls to prevent Pepin from using them against him. This final phase of the war was fought with increasing brutality, and the chroniclers record that Pepin burnt villas, despoiled vineyards and depopulated monasteries. During this period (763\u201366) the fortress of Berry was held by a Frankish garrison. By 766 most of Waiofar's followers had abandoned him, but the war over Aquitaine did not end even with his death, shortly before Pepin's own, in 768. The final active phase of the war between the two (766\u201367) was fought mainly in the P\u00e9rigord, the Angoumois and the Bordelais, all regions closer to Gascony, which if not ruled directly by Waiofar was either under his control or allied to him. The chroniclers record how Pepin destroyed fortresses and cities, castella and civitates, and so devastated the countryside that \"there was no settler to work the land\" (nullus colonus terram ad laborandam). Around this time, Pepin defeated the Gascons in pitched battle. In 768, the erstwhile count of Bourges, Blandinus, submitted to Pepin. Most of Waiofar's family was captured and executed in the forest of P\u00e9rigord. Waiofar himself was assassinated by his own men, allegedly at Pippin's instigation. A kinsman, perhaps his son, Hunald II, succeeded to his claims on Aquitaine and continued to fight against Pepin's successor, Charles. There is one charter issued by Waiofar preserved in the cartulary of the basilica of Saint-Julien at Brioude. Styling himself and his predecessor, Hunald, \"princes\" (principes), Waiofar granted a villa to one Gedeon as a precarium for life in exchange for another villa and two pounds of silver. The charter was drawn up around 756\u201357 (\"in the month of September in the 12th year of lord Waifarius, prince\") in the Limagne (\"in pago limanico\"). Waiofar may have been copying the policy of his rival Pepin from 743\u201344, when the latter ordered his followers who had received church lands to return them to the church, make a payment (cens) and receive them back as precaria verbo regis (\"by the king's word\") from the church. By creating precaria, Waiofar could raise men and troops to defend Aquitaine from the impending war with Pepin. The continuator of Fredegar records how Waiofar confiscated church lands and distributed them to his followers. According to Adhemar of Chabannes, writing 250 years later, Pepin granted two villas to the canons of the abbey of Saint-Martial and the cathedral of Saint-\u00c9tienne at Limoges during his wars with Waiofar. Although much is known of Waiofar's wars with Pepin the Short, little is known of his administration of Aquitaine. He did use counts (Latin comites, singular comes) to govern major cities (civitates, sing. civitas) in the Frankish manner. At least Bourges, Poitiers and the Auvergne had Aquitainian counts. In the case of Thouars, which was merely a castle (castra), a count was appointed to command the garrison (custodes). Archibald Lewis suggests that the abundance of Gascon (Basque) troops among Waiofar's forces stems from an unrecorded alliance with Duke Lupus II of Gascony; in the same way he suggests Pepin formed an alliance with the Goths of Septimania after his conquest of Narbonne. Waiofar's uncle Remistanius, although he was not in the service of the duke, was wealthy enough to form an army to besiege several Carolingian garrisons. In 765, Pepin bribed Remistanius with gold, silver, cloth, horses and arms to come over to his side. He appointed him to govern eastern half of the region of Bourges up to the river Cher and granted him control of the citadel in the city itself. At the time, Chunibert, who had served as count of Bourges under Waiofar until he lost the city to Pepin in 762, was again serving as count, this time to Pepin.

Farrah won the applause of the audience, and since then she has aspired to become an artist. After graduation from high school, Farrah gained a scholarship to study medicine in Italy, where she gained experience in western styles of singing and learned to sing in English, French and Italian. In 2011 Yousef had the chance to perform the theme song of a Syrian series, \"Wilada Mina Al Khassira\". In 2012 she performed the theme song for two series, \"Bet Amer\" and \"Al Amemy\". Following the success of the first season of Arab Idol, MBC launched the second season on March 8, 2013. Back in Syria, the civil war was affecting the whole country, resulting in Yousef being hesitant to audition. She was encouraged by her friends and family to achieve her dream. She said that watching the program inspired her to give it a try. She almost failed to leave Syria as her car was caught in the middle of a shootout as she left Damascus to audition in Beirut. Television viewers first saw Yousef during the audition episodes at the beginning of Arab Idols second season. The show's judges included Ragheb Alama, Nancy Ajram, Ahlam and Hassan El Shafei. Farrah performed \"Ifrah Ya Albi\" by Umm Kulthum and got accepted to the next round. In Beirut, where the competition was held, outdoor cafes put up big screens and the sound of Yousef\u2019s voice drifted down streets. Yousef said her performance mirrored the way she feels when singing on stage when she often thinks of her family.

She says that she tries to make people love one another again using the healing power of music.

He was a maternal grandson of Nicolai Lumholtz and brother of Carl Nicolai Stoud Platou, and through the latter an uncle of Valborg Platou and Lars Hannibal Sommerfeldt Stoud Platou.

In 1842 he started holding lectures at the university, and in the same year, when Ulrik Anton Motzfeldt became a Supreme Court Assessor, Platou was hired as a lecturer of jurisprudence from June 1843. In 1849 he was promoted to professor, although there was a vote of dissent in the government\u2014some wanted Frans Christian Faye to advance from lecturer to professor of medicine instead. The dissent went to the Parliament of Norway in 1851, but no change was made. He published little; only one noteworthy book, Om Besiddelse efter norsk Ret (\"On Possession after Norwegian Law\") in 1863. He also participated in ad hoc law commissions. In 1877 he received an honorary degree at Uppsala University. From 1862 to 1864 he was a Supreme Court Assessor, but after 1864 he was only extraordinary Assessor in some cases at the same time as being district stipendiary magistrate in Nes District Court. His son Oscar was deputy judge here from 1870 to 1871. during King Oscar II's travel in Germany from May to June 1875; then during King Oscar II's travel in Russia in July 1875; then during the King's and the Crown Prince's travel in Russia in September 1881.

The film stars Morissette as Patrick Lupien, an owner of a sporting goods store who is becoming dissatisfied with the empty consumerism of his day-to-day life and the loss of emotional and sexual intimacy in his relationship with Isabelle (Julie Perreault). Critics compared the film's themes and plot to both The Decline of the American Empire and American Beauty. The film was the second highest-grossing Quebec film of 2015, after Snowtime! Patrick, a sporting goods store manager, is in his office watching a pornographic film, which features two buxom women and a pool boy. Patrick does a walkthrough the store, and informs various employees to please not text while they should be working. On his way home, he ogles a pretty blond driving a convertible, and runs into the back of another car causing minor damage. At home, he complains about his wife's spending, and the cost of some necessary work on their very nice suburban home. His wife Isabelle (Isa) mentions that she has been off on stress leave. That evening, they try to have sex, but Isa complains that her antidepressants suppress her sex drive. At his son's soccer game, he chats with Michel, another father. Michel and his wife, Roxanne, come over for dinner. Patrick and Isa humble-brag about how much their new kitchen has cost them. After dinner, in the hot tub, the neighbour wife shows off her $6,000 boob job, taking off her top so Isa can see how small the scars are and feel how realistic they are. Later Patrick is watching the same porn movie, but one of the characters now is played by the neighbour. Patrick himself is the pool boy. Back at work, a supplier says he cannot deliver the next season's merchandise until the previous bill is paid. After work the two couples go out for a nice dinner. When Patrick's main credit card is rejected, he pays the bill with two credit cards and some cash. On the way home the other couple suggest that they drop into a swinger's club. The other couple have been two or three times previously, and have fantasized about having sex with Patrick and Isa. Isa is uncomfortable, but still enjoys a kiss with the other wife. The next day at work, the mall landlord informs Patrick that he will be raising his rent. Patrick tried to get a loan to make some improvements to the store, but is rejected by the bank because he is already overextended. Patrick sets up a tennis game with Roxanne. He enjoys watching her boobs while she volleys. She suggests that she show Patrick a nice ski chalet that she is the sales agent for. Although Patrick knows they cannot afford it, he says he may take her up on it later. Isa asks Patrick if she should get a boob job, and reminds him that the $4,500 cost of their son's school is due. Patrick knows they cannot afford either. Isa is upset that Patrick does not want her looking better. Patrick suggests that he and Roxanne travel to a mixed doubles tennis competition. Roxanne is busy with some open houses, and declines. Instead, Patrick asks a co-worker if she would like to travel to a sales meeting. She is excited and agrees. When they arrive, they find the hotel room they planned to share has only one bed instead of two. Neither are too upset. At the sales meeting, Patrick finds out that his franchise is being taken back by the parent company. The sales girl enjoys the night out, and they return to the room, ready for sex. Patrick is too aggressive, and the girl becomes upset. Patrick arranges to see the chalet with Roxanne, but comes on to her while they are checking it out. She bluntly tells him no, but he still tries. She throws him out, and calls her husband, who goes over to see Isa. Patrick arrives home, and waits for Michel to leave. Isa is very upset, and throws him out of the house. He heads to their small trailer, and thinks about reconnecting with his family and friends while jogging. He imagines returning home to his loving children, but realizes that Isa will have called her mother, and they will not let him return. He returns to his run as the credits roll.\n",

        "reference": " Calkins Music on Market Street in San Francisco, California. One of his students, Lee Humphries, kept telling John about the talents of his buddy Joe Crane, with whom he was in the Coast Guard. Joe played bass with Johnny & Edgar Winter in high school back in Conroe, Texas, and had been produced by the infamous Huey Meaux. Between Lee's description, and confirmation from Al Amis, who also worked at Roger Calkins and had heard Joe sing, John went to the Alameda, California, Coast Guard Officer's Club to see Joe perform, and the Hoodoo Rhythm Devils were born. Another one of John's guitar students, \"Funky Jack\" Leahy, who lived up the street from John in the Haight-Ashbury district, had just closed his poster business Funky Features, and was getting into recording and was building a studio. When Jack heard Joe and John, he took the lead and started recording the band and making connections for the band to get a recording contract with a major label. After a few personnel changes, Glenn Walter, who had played drums in a band called The Zoo and released a single in St. Louis, Missouri, with John during the 1960s, joined the band, along with Richard Greene (aka Dexter C. Plates) on bass. Richard had played in groups around the Washington, D.C. area, most notably with Roberta Flack. Modeled after the names of bands in the 1950s, Joe Crane and his Hoodoo Rhythm Devils signed with Capitol Records under the direction of Michael Sunday and Jack Leahy, made their first record Rack Jobber's Rule in 1971. The name was too big of a mouthful, so it was shortened to the Hoodoo Rhythm Devils. Roger Allen Clark, fresh from the Steve Miller Band, was added on drums with the second album, The Barbecue of DeVille on Blue Thumb Records in 1972. The Hoodoos toured extensively that year playing with Savoy Brown, The Doobie Brothers, Steely Dan, Chuck Berry, John Lee Hooker, Graham Central Station, Tower of Power, Mott the Hoople, Bloodrock, and The Tubes. Roger Clark left to become a studio session drummer working for Rick Hall in Muscle Shoals, Alabama. Keith Knudsen, formerly of Lee Michaels' band and later the Doobie Brothers, then joined for a short stint on drums from late 1972 to mid 1973 before Jerome Kimsey joined the band for the recording of their third album, What the Kids Want, for Blue Thumb Records in 1973. The Hoodoos continued to tour the United States and Joe began having some of his songs covered by Johnny Winter, The Chambers Brothers, Rodger Collins, and Patti LaBelle. In 1973 Richard Greene left to become a sought-after recording engineer at Russian Hill Recording in San Francisco, and was the famous \"Fall Into The Gap\" voice. Roger Stanton replaced Richard on bass. 1973 and 1974 saw non-stop touring and took the band from Canada to Texas, California to Florida tearing up many a dancehall and 'burning down' many a nightclub. The band went their separate ways in 1974, only to reform a year later with a new lineup and recorded the famous \"Lost Album\" that was never released until 2012. Jack Leahy and Bob Simmons of KSAN-FM in San Francisco formed World Records, and recorded, produced, and released the album Safe In Their Homes in 1976. Fantasy Records in Berkeley, California, re-released Safe in Their Homes. The Hoodoo Rhythm Devils was revived and strong playing concerts and clubs. (See Wolfgang's Vault for live concerts from Winterland in San Francisco). In 1978, Crane and Walters, recorded their second Fantasy Records album All Kidding Aside, which was produced by Clayton Ivey and Terry Woodford. It included guest musicians the Muscle Shoals Horns, Roger Allen Clark, Tom Roady, and many other well-known Muscle Shoals session kings. The band continued on until Joe Crane died from leukemia in 1980. After the band's demise, several compilations were released by Rear Window Music. In 2013, the Hoodoo Rhythm Devils released a live recording recorded at Ultrasonic Studios in Hempstead, New York on November 28, 1972 that had been broadcast live on WLIR-FM. In 2014 they released One Night Only, a CD which featured some jams with Johnny Winter and a live recording of the Texas Day Special with the Pointer Sisters that had been broadcast live on KSAN-FM from San Francisco in 1973. 2016 brought The Best Of The Hoodoo Rhythm Devils Volume II CD that featured a variety of unreleased tunes, demos, and a reunion tune with surviving members and their children. The album also features Tower of Power, The Pointer Sisters, Norton Buffalo, Greg Douglass, John McFee, and the Two Tons of Fun - Martha Wash and the late Izora Armstead. Glenn Walters has carried on as fixture vocalist and drummer in the San Francisco area, well known in the advertising business with his Taco Bell, Blue Diamond Almonds, Selix Tuxedos, etc., spots, and gigs regularly with the Glenn Walters Quartet and with Sidepocket, a cover band that performs for weddings and other social events. Richard Greene is a member of The Bobs, the Grammy-winning a capella group.

        "prefix": "Fibrillation is the rapid, irregular, and unsynchronized contraction of muscle fibers. An important occurrence is with regard to the heart. There are two",
        "reference": " major classes of cardiac fibrillation: atrial fibrillation and ventricular fibrillation. Atrial fibrillation is an irregular and uncoordinated contraction of the cardiac muscle of atria. It can be a chronic condition, usually treated with anticoagulation and sometimes with conversion to normal sinus rhythm. In this condition the normal electrical pulses coming from the sinoatrial node are overwhelmed by disorganized electrical impulses usually originating in the roots of the pulmonary veins, leading to irregular conduction of impulses to the ventricles which generate the heartbeat. Ventricular fibrillation is an irregular and uncoordinated contraction of the cardiac muscle of ventricles. It is a common cause of cardiac arrest and is usually fatal if not reversed by defibrillation. Fibrillation may sometimes be used after heart surgery to stop the heart from beating while any minor leaks are stitched up. Fibrillation also occurs with individual skeletal muscle fibers. This happens when muscle fibers lose contact with their innervating axon producing a spontaneous action potential, \"fibrillation potential\" that results in the muscle fiber's contraction. These contractions are not visible under the skin and are detectable through needle electromyography (EMG) and ultrasound. Fibrillations can occur in healthy individuals. If the fibrillations have irregular potentials then they don't have pathological significance. In other cases they are a major symptom in acute and severe peripheral nerve disorders, in myopathies in which muscle fibers are split or inflamed, and in lower motor neuron lesions. They contrast with fasciculations that are visible spontaneous contractions involving small groups of muscle fibers. Fasciculations can be seen in lower motor neuron lesions as well, but they also do not necessarily denote pathology. The word fibrillation () is related to the word fibril in the sense of muscle fibrils, the proteins that make up each muscle fiber (muscle cell).\n",

        "prefix": "Dale Enterprise is an unincorporated community in Rockingham County, Virginia, United States. The name dates to 1872, when it was time to name",
        "reference": " the village's post office. The place was previously known as Millersville, after the Miller family who ran an early store there. After the Civil War, Mr. J. W. Minnick started a new mercantile \u201centerprise\u201d at the crossroads of Silver Lake Road and Route 33. Minnick\u2019s store was located near a \u201cdale,\u201d so the chosen name became Dale Enterprise. Dale Enterprise is located at latitude 38. 455 N and longitude 78. 939 W in the Shenandoah Valley, approximately four miles west of the City of Harrisonburg along U. S. Highway 33 (the Rawley Pike).,, The community is shown on the Bridgewater U.S. Geological Survey Map and is in the Eastern time zone. Dale Enterprise sits at an elevation of 1408 feet, on the northeastern foot of the 1898-foot high Mole Hill, an igneous intrusion that is believed to have been the core of a volcano that has eroded away over the years. Dale Enterprise is at the northern edge of \u201cThe Burnt District,\u201d an area in which in early October, 1864, during the American Civil War, Union General Philip Sheridan ordered all of the houses to be burned in retribution for the death of a young staff officer, Lieutenant John Rodgers Meigs. Lt. Meigs was mortally wounded by Confederate cavalry scouts a couple miles southeast of Dale Enterprise on October 3, 1864. Many families in the Dale Enterprise vicinity lost their homes, farm buildings, and livestock in the ensuing destruction, despite the fact that most of the area families were pacifist Mennonites. Lewis \u201cL. J.\u201d Heatwole, the son of David and Catherine Driver Heatwole, started keeping a weather diary at his parents\u2019 farm in Dale Enterprise in 1868 at the age of 15. In 1884, the U.S. Signal Service designated Heatwole as a \"voluntary observer\". Four years later, Heatwole set up the Dale Enterprise weather station. The Dale Enterprise station is the oldest operating weather station in Virginia and the third oldest in the nation, and has been operated by the same family since its founding. The station is located in a farm field, \u201cwell away from buildings or hard surfaces\u201d. As of early 2010, the station\u2019s original thermometer remained as a back-up to an electronic temperature sensor installed in 1994. The Blosser Printing Press was established by Abraham Blosser in the late 19th century in his home near Dale Enterprise. His main publication at the press is noted as the Watchful Pilgrim, a semimonthly paper he edited and printed for several years, starting in 1880. David Taylor was the typesetter. The press also ran a tract concerning Mennonite baptism practices \u2013 Eine Verhandlung von den \u00e4usserlichen Wasser-Taufe (Harrisonburg, Virginia, 1816) originally written in German by Peter Burkholder. In addition, Blosser printed his own tracts and did custom work. The history of the Dale Enterprise School dates to 1877 when Peter and Nancy Heatwole deeded about half an acre of their farm to Rockingham County for a school. The frame Piney Grove School was built on the property in 1885, in a pine grove next to the H & R Springs Turnpike, later to become U.S. Highway 33. In the summer of 1909, the County school board razed the Piney Grove schoolhouse and built the new Dale Enterprise School on the property. A 1914 County schools history refers to the new school as \"a beautiful three-room brick house,\" and notes that \"[t]he house is supplied with water from the Harrisonburg mains, and is modern except its lack of sanitary toilets\". The school included grades 1-7. Each of the three classrooms had \u201ccombined classes\". After the school closed in 1963, the building stood vacant until 1975, but since then has served several uses, including its present use as the Harrisonburg Unitarian Universalist Fellowship\u2019s church.\n",

It is affiliated to Utkal University which is one of the largest affiliating universities. The institute began functioning in 1999 inside a room of the Pathani Samanta Planetarium in Bhubaneswar. In July 2008, IMA acquired its own residential campus, built by Tata Steel in Bhubaneswar city, when it was established as a full-fledged, degree granting academic institution. The main institute is a  complex, which was designed by architect Karan Grover, with an investment of Rs. 140 million. The  campus also includes computer laboratories, classrooms, a library, as well as residential accommodations. A play ground and a volleyball court are also included. The current focus areas of research within the institute include wavelet analysis, stochastic processes, functional analysis, Algebraic Topology, Differential Geometry, Group Representations, operator theory, fuzzy logic, geometric application in physics, approximation theory, Lie Algebra, Astronomy, Thermodynamics and Statistical Physics, Quantum Mechanics and cyclone modelling, Machine Learning in Finance, Computational Finance. The institute offers a B. Sc. Honors degree in Mathematics and Computation as well as M. Sc. degrees in Computational Finance and Data Science. It currently admits 30 students each year based on a national entrance examination. It also provides training to school students for mathematical competitions. The institute professes to investigate the mathematical tradition of ancient India. It also provides awards to eminent mathematicians in the state of Odisha. B.Sc. The institute offers a Bachelor of Science (Honours) Degree in Mathematics and Computing. The course includes the study of pure mathematics as well as mathematical modeling and the use of abstract methods to solve concrete problems. Computer Science is major and compulsory for every student and it includes the study of Algorithms design, analysis, Cellular Automata and other branches in Theoretical Computer Science. Rigorous training and lot of exposure in pure mathematics is given to the students. In the final semester, each student must submit a dissertation. M.A./M. Sc. Finance as a subject has emerged to be an extremely involved branch of knowledge with growing number of stock exchanges and investors in the field. Risk and return that constitute cardinal aspects of the subject, remain as a major concern for every investor, individual as well as institutional. Volumes of data encountered in the process make investment decisions difficult. In apparently erratic behaviors of the market, however the mathematicians try to capture patterns vis- a-vis predictability, which may help investors decide on their investment. Computational finance otherwise called financial engineering deals with portfolio selection, options and futures, asset pricing, managing derivative markets and hedging under uncertainty. The course imparts, besides, basic grounding on finance, expertise for modeling under uncertainty, a high level of computational skill geared towards finance, knowledge of financial accounting and regulations. The aim is to produce a competent financial engineer capable of analyzing existing financial products and suggest new innovative products for the financial market. M.A./M. Sc. From 2018, the institute started a master's degree course in Data Science, one of the emerging fields of the current day. It is a programme of 2 years, after which the candidates are granted a M.Sc. degree from the Utkal University.\n",

        "reference": " of her brother, King Charles VIII, and the annulment of her marriage. After that, she retired to her domain, where she soon founded the monastic Order of the Sisters of the Annunciation of Mary, where she served as abbess. From this Order later sprang the religious congregation of the Apostolic Sisters of the Annunciation, founded in 1787 to teach the children of the poor. She was canonized on 28 May 1950 and is known in the Roman Catholic Church as Saint Joan of Valois, O.Ann.M.. Joan was born on 23 April 1464 in the castle of Pierre II de Br\u00e9z\u00e9, a trusted supporter of her grandfather, King Charles VII of France, at Nogent-le-Roi in the County of Dreux. She was the second daughter of King Louis XI of France and of his second wife Charlotte of Savoy; her surviving siblings were King Charles VIII of France and Anne of France. Shortly after her birth, the king signed an agreement to marry her to his second cousin Louis, the Duke of Orl\u00e9ans, later King Louis XII of France, who was aged two at the time. Joan was born sickly and deformed. In Women Saints \u2013 Lives of Faith and Courage, Kathleen Jones says that Joan had a hump on her back and walked with a limp, suggesting that she had curvature of the spine. Often away on royal duties, King Louis entrusted his daughters, Joan and Anne, to the Baron Fran\u00e7ois de Lini\u00e8res and his wife, Anne de Culan. The couple, who were childless, lavished affection on Joan. Taking charge of her education, they had her taught both poetry and mathematics, painting, embroidery and how to play the lute. The couple were also faithful Catholics and instilled in the members of their household a solid grounding in the faith. At a young age, her father asked her to name the confessor she wanted. She gave him the only name she knew, that of Friar Jean de La Fontaine, Guardian of the Franciscan friary in Amboise. The king approved her choice and appointed the friar to this post. Despite the distance between them, he would travel regularly to hear the princess's confession. Joan began to develop a strong pleasure in prayer, and would pass long periods in the castle chapel. The baron supported her in this and had a path paved between the castle and the chapel built for easier walking in poor weather. Under the friar's guidance she was admitted into the Third Order of St. Francis. In 1471 King Louis XI ordered the catechism of reciting the Hail Mary for peace to be practised throughout the kingdom. Joan had a strong attachment to this particular prayer. She would later write that it was in that same year that she had received a prophecy from the Virgin Mary that some day she would found a religious community in honor of Our Lady. In 1473 King Louis had signed marriage contracts for his daughters. On 8 September 1476, at the age of 12, Joan was married to the young Louis, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans in Montrichard. Louis of Orl\u00e9ans was compelled to be married to his handicapped and supposedly sterile cousin Joan. By doing so, Louis XI hoped to extinguish the Orl\u00e9ans cadet branch of the House of Valois. Louis was displeased at the forced marriage, and his treatment of his new wife reflected this. King Louis died in 1483 and was succeeded by his son Charles, but as he was still a child, his sister, Anne de Beaujeu, was made Regent of the kingdom. By 1484, the duke had begun a series of military campaigns against the kingdom. This lasted until 1488, when he was taken captive by the royal forces. During this period, he fathered an illegitimate son, Michel de Bussy, who was later appointed the Bishop of Bourges. Joan administered his domain during his imprisonment, especially the Italian cities of Milan and Asti. Joan, imagining virtues in her husband that did not exist, exerted herself to mitigate his sufferings and to get him freed. Duke Louis was released in 1491. Within a few years, he accompanied King Charles on his military campaign in Italy. When Louis ascended to the throne in April 1498 after the accidental death of Joan's brother, King Charles VIII, he appealed to the pope to have the marriage annulled in order to marry the late king's widow, Anne of Brittany, in the hope of annexing the Duchy of Brittany to the French Crown. In what has been described as \"one of the seamiest lawsuits of the age\", Louis did not, as might be expected, argue the marriage to be void due to consanguinity (the general excuse for the dissolution of a marriage at that time). Louis argued that he had been below the legal age of consent (fourteen) to marry and that the marriage had never been consummated due to her physical deformity, and provided a rich variety of detail as to how she was malformed. Joan, unsurprisingly, fought this uncertain charge fiercely, producing witnesses to Louis boasting of having \"mounted my wife three or four times during the night\". Louis also claimed that his sexual performance had been inhibited by witchcraft; Joan responded by asking how, in that case, he was able to know what it was like to try to make love to her. Joan would likely have won, for Louis's case was exceedingly weak, however Pope Alexander VI was committed for political reasons to grant the annulment. The commission of investigation appointed by the pope established that the marriage with Joan was invalid for lack of consent and that it never had been consummated. Accordingly, he ruled against the Queen. The annulment was declared on 15 December 1498. Joan stepped aside, saying that she would pray for her former husband. She was made Duchess of Berry and retired to Bourges, capital of the duchy. Once settled in her new domain, Joan confided to her spiritual director, the Blessed Gabriel Mary, O.F.M.,  her call to monastic life. He supported her in this venture, and she began to make plans for the Order of the Annunciation of the Blessed Virgin Mary, a new enclosed religious order in honour of the Annunciation (the announcement to Mary by an angel that she would become the mother of Jesus, although she was a virgin). It was established as an independent branch of the Poor Clares. By May 1500 she had received 11 postulants, the nucleus of the new Order. The Rule of Life she had written for the Order was approved on 12 February 1502 by Pope Alexander. Construction of the first monastery was begun the following year. On Pentecost Sunday 1504, Joan and Friar Gabriel Mary made private commitments to follow the Rule, and thereby established themselves as co-founders of the Order. On 21 November of that same year, the Feast of the Presentation of Mary, Joan and the other women publicly and legally committed themselves to the Order. Joan died on 4 February 1505 and was buried in the chapel of the Annonciade monastery. Her grave, however, was desecrated and her body, found to be incorrupt at that time, was burned by the Huguenots during their sack of Bourges on 27 May 1562. Soon after her death, miracles and healings attributed to her were said to have occurred. The cause for her canonization was begun in 1631 and Pope Benedict XIV beatified her on 21 April 1742. She was canonized on 28 May 1950 by Pope Pius XII. The nuns of the Order of the Annunciation of the Blessed Virgin Mary still maintain their way of life in monasteries in France, Belgium, Costa Rica and Poland. The Religious Sisters serve in Belgium, Burundi, Cameroon, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, France and Guatemala.\n",

Zierfandler wines are typically elegant and quite sweet, but with lots of balancing acidity and a nutty bouquet of pistachios and almonds. They are capable of ageing well. Zierfandler is probably a cross between Roter Veltliner and something like Traminer. A \"weiss\" (white) form is found in Hungary. Zierfandler may be the inadvertent origin of the name Zinfandel, which has its roots in a Croatian grape collected by the Habsburg monarchy in Vienna. George Gibbs, a horticulturist on Long Island, received several shipments of vines from the Imperial nursery in the 1820s, one of which he called \"Black Zinfardel of Hungary\". This doesn't correspond to any known grape, but Webster suggests that Zinfandel is a corruption of tzinif\u00e1ndli (czirifandli), a Hungarian word derived from  the German word Zierfandler. Since Zierfandler is very different from Zinfandel, someone would have had to have mixed up labels along the way. There were 98. 24ha in Austria in 2005, less than 0. 3% of Austria vineyards, of which 85. 03ha were in Thermenregion. It is traditionally blended with Rotgipfler in that region. These wines, known as Sp\u00e4trot-Rotgipfler, are a particular speciality of Gumpoldskirchen, south of Vienna. It is grown in Hungary under the name Cirfandli and in Slovenia as Zerjavina.

        "prefix": "Mean shift is a non-parametric feature-space analysis technique for locating the maxima of a density function, a so-called mode-seeking algorithm",
        "reference": ". Application domains include cluster analysis in computer vision and image processing. The mean shift procedure was originally presented in 1975 by Fukunaga and Hostetler. Mean shift is a procedure for locating the maxima\u2014the modes\u2014of a density function given discrete data sampled from that function. This is an iterative method, and we start with an initial estimate. Let a kernel function  be given. This function determines the weight of nearby points for re-estimation of the mean. Typically a Gaussian kernel on the distance to the current estimate is used,. where  is the neighborhood of, a set of points for which. The difference  is called mean shift in Fukunaga and Hostetler. The mean-shift algorithm now sets, and repeats the estimation until  converges. Although the mean shift algorithm has been widely used in many applications, a rigid proof for the convergence of the algorithm using a general kernel in a high dimensional space is still not known. Aliyari Ghassabeh showed the convergence of the mean shift algorithm in one-dimension with a differentiable, convex, and strictly decreasing profile function. However, the one-dimensional case has limited real world applications. Also, the convergence of the algorithm in higher dimensions with a finite number of the (or isolated) stationary points has been proved. However, sufficient conditions for a general kernel function to have finite (or isolated) stationary points have not been provided. Let data be a finite set  embedded in the -dimensional Euclidean space,. In each iteration of the algorithm,  is performed for all  simultaneously. The first question, then, is how to estimate the density function given a sparse set of samples. where  are the input samples and  is the kernel function (or Parzen window). is the only parameter in the algorithm and is called the bandwidth. This approach is known as kernel density estimation or the Parzen window technique. Once we have computed  from equation above, we can find its local maxima using gradient ascent or some other optimization technique. The problem with this \"brute force\" approach is that, for higher dimensions, it becomes computationally prohibitive to evaluate  over the complete search space. Instead, mean shift uses a variant of what is known in the optimization literature as multiple restart gradient descent. Starting at some guess for a local maximum,, which can be a random input data point, mean shift computes the gradient of the density estimate  at  and takes an uphill step in that direction. Kernel definition: Let  be the -dimensional Euclidean space,. The norm of  is a non-negative number,. k is non-negative. k is non-increasing:  if. where the standard deviation parameter  works as the bandwidth parameter,. Consider a set of points in two-dimensional space. Assume a circular window centered at C and having radius r as the kernel. Mean shift is a hill climbing algorithm which involves shifting this kernel iteratively to a higher density region until convergence. Every shift is defined by a mean shift vector. The mean shift vector always points toward the direction of the maximum increase in the density. At every iteration the kernel is shifted to the centroid or the mean of the points within it. The method of calculating this mean depends on the choice of the kernel. In this case if a Gaussian kernel is chosen instead of a flat kernel, then every point will first be assigned a weight which will decay exponentially as the distance from the kernel's center increases. At convergence, there will be no direction at which a shift can accommodate more points inside the kernel. The mean shift algorithm can be used for visual tracking. The simplest such algorithm would create a confidence map in the new image based on the color histogram of the object in the previous image, and use mean shift to find the peak of a confidence map near the object's old position. The confidence map is a probability density function on the new image, assigning each pixel of the new image a probability, which is the probability of the pixel color occurring in the object in the previous image. expand on this idea. Let  and  be the -dimensional input and filtered image pixels in the joint spatial-range domain. Compute  according to  until convergence,. Assign. The superscripts s and r denote the spatial and range components of a vector, respectively. The assignment specifies that the filtered data at the spatial location axis will have the range component of the point of convergence. Mean shift is an application-independent tool suitable for real data analysis. Does not assume any predefined shape on data clusters. It is capable of handling arbitrary feature spaces. The procedure relies on choice of a single parameter: bandwidth. The bandwidth/window size 'h' has a physical meaning, unlike k-means. The selection of a window size is not trivial. Inappropriate window size can cause modes to be merged, or generate additional \u201cshallow\u201d modes. Often requires using adaptive window size. ELKI.

        "prefix": "Reginald Lewis Ball (born October 6, 1984) is a former American football quarterback. He was originally signed by the Detroit Lions as an undrafted free agent",
        "reference": " in 2007. He played college football at Georgia Tech. Ball played his high school football at Stephenson High School in Stone Mountain, Georgia. As a senior, he passed for over 2,000 yards with 19 touchdowns and just two interceptions. He was named to the Super Southern 100 and Top 50 in Georgia by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. Also, he was rated the number 133 player in Georgia by BorderWars.com and ranked among the nation's top 15 all-purpose quarterbacks by Rivals.com. Ball was the first true freshman to start at quarterback for Georgia Tech since Stu Rogers in 1980. Ball's first start was in the Yellow Jackets' opening game against BYU in 2003. Since then, he missed just one game and amassed 8,128 passing yards, 57 touchdown passes and 9,579 total yards of offense in his career, but also threw 55 interceptions. Ball's passing yards total is third on Georgia Tech's career list, behind Joe Hamilton and Shawn Jones, and his touchdown pass and total offense totals are second behind Hamilton. Ball accumulated 11 rushing touchdowns and also rushed for 1,451 yards in his career, good for 18th on the Yellow Jacket leaderboard and second among Tech quarterbacks in history (Hamilton). He wore jersey number 1. During his career, Ball was named ACC Rookie of the Year in 2003 and was named the MVP of the Champs Sports Bowl in 2004. He compiled a  record of 29-20 as the starting quarterback for the Yellow Jackets. Ball, whose athleticism was well noted as CouchScout.com listed him at 4. 46 in the 40-yard dash, led Georgia Tech to three 7-win seasons in a row. He capped off his career with a 9-5 mark in 2006 that included a #25 ranking nationally (heading into the Toyota Gator Bowl) and an ACC Coastal Division Championship. In 2005, Georgia Tech was trailing UGA 7-14 with 1st & 10 at the UGA 11. Ball threw an interception that helped secure a victory for the Bulldogs. Thus stretching the streak to five games over their in state rivals. Ball started his senior season for the Yellow Jackets by leading the team to a sterling 9-2 record, but his collegiate career ended on a negative note on December 2, 2006, with a 9-6 loss in the ACC Championship Game to Wake Forest, just one week after Ball's Georgia Tech team lost to in-state rival UGA for a sixth straight year. He completed less than 30% (15-51) of his passes in these last two games, threw four interceptions, and gave up a crucial fumble in the loss to Georgia. Although Georgia Tech earned a spot to play West Virginia in the Gator Bowl that year, Ball's controversial career abruptly ended when he was named academically ineligible, and backup quarterback Taylor Bennett was named the starter. He left Georgia Tech after this season having completed only 44% of his passes, the worst mark of his four-year career, and not receiving an academic degree. Ball's college career will forever be marred with inconsistency. The teams he led \"played to the level of the opponent,\" producing several impressive upsets while losing \"easier\" games. Although he won several big games for the Jackets including two wins against ranked Auburn University teams and a win against #3 University of Miami on the road in 2005, Ball-led Yellow Jacket teams were 0-4 against the University of Georgia, Georgia Tech's primary rival. Ball's play in these games (including, in 2004, a drive-ending intentional incomplete pass out of bounds on 4th down and earning him the nickname \"5th Down Reggie\") will always be in question to Georgia Tech fans. He finished his career by losing to UGA, losing the ACC Championship game to Wake Forest, and being declared academically ineligible for the 2007 Gator Bowl, which would have been his final game. College football writer Pete Fiutak, contributor to the website Collegefootballnews.com, challenged readers to name a more ineffective four-year college football starter than Ball. Brett Jensen compared his career to that of the Clemson Tigers' Charlie Whitehurst; both had impressive freshman seasons, but they were unable to live up to the expectations placed upon them. At the NFL Combine, Ball tried out as a wide receiver, attempting to follow former college quarterbacks Antwaan Randle El and Reggie McNeal. He ran a 4. 8 second 40-yard dash, and had somewhat inconsistent pass coverage. Ball was not selected during the 2007 NFL Draft, but was signed by the Detroit Lions, auditioning for a role as a wide receiver/kick returner. He did not make the team. On December 5, he was re-signed to the practice squad when defensive back LaMarcus Hicks was placed on injured reserve and wide receiver Brandon Middleton was promoted to the active roster. On July 27, 2008, he was placed on injured reserve. Ball was released by the Lions on March 18, 2009. Ball signed to play for the now-defunct Bricktown Brawlers of the Indoor Football League in 2011.\n",

The Ku Klux Klan is notorious for encouraging extremist practices of white supremacy in the Southern United States. They were responsible for multiple lynchings of black people who decided to vote following Snipes' murder. For example, two black couples were lynched five days later. Prior to the election, they made threats to lynch any black person who dared cast a vote. Snipes and his mother were both sharecroppers on Homer Chapman's land in Butler, Georgia. The day after Snipes cast his vote, four white men pulled up to the land Chapman rented to Snipes' family. All of the four white men were suspected KKK members. Two of the men were later identified as Edward Williamson and Lynwood Harvey. Williamson and Snipes both happened to be WWII veterans. When the four white men pulled up outside of Maceo's grandfather's house, they asked Maceo's mother to call him outside. They confronted him and it ended in Williamson shooting Maceo in the back. After the men left, he and his mother walked to Chapman's house. Chapman helped them walk 3 miles to the hospital in Butler. The hospital staff did not treat Snipes until six hours later. By then, he needed a blood transfusion. The staff claimed that they did not have any \"black blood\". Two days later, Snipes died in the hospital from his injuries. Williamson was an initial suspect in the investigation. In front of a coroner's jury, he claimed that Maceo owed him a $10 debt. Supposedly, Williamson and Harvey went to Maceo to confront him on his debt. Williamson said that Maceo had pulled out a knife, so he shot Maceo twice in the back, claiming self-defense. Coroner J.D. Cooke and a jury declared Williamson's actions as justified. Williamson was exonerated on his charges on July 29, 1946. The Butler funeral director and Snipes' uncle buried Maceo at an unmarked grave in the Butler cemetery. Today, no one knows exactly where Maceo's body is buried. He did not receive a proper empty casket burial until 61 years later. Maceo's story, along with the murder of the two black couples received a lot of attention in the newspapers, such as the Atlanta Constitution. While studying at Morehouse, Martin Luther King Jr. wrote a letter in response to the newspaper's remarks on the killings of Maceo Snipes and the two black couples.\n",

        "prefix": "\"\" (What God Ordains Is Always Good) is a Lutheran hymn written by the pietist German poet and schoolmaster Samuel Rodigast in 16",
        "reference": "75. The melody has been attributed to the cantor Severus Gastorius. An earlier hymn with the same title was written in the first half of the seventeenth century by the theologian Michael Altenburg. As described in, an apocryphal account in the 1687 Nordhausen Gesangbuch (Nordhausen songbook) records that the hymn text was written by Samuel Rodigast in 1675 while his friend, the cantor Severus Gastorius, whom he knew from school and university, was \"seriously ill\" and confined to his bed in Jena. The account credits Gastorius, believing himself to be on his death bed, with composing the hymn melody as music for his funeral. When Gastorius recovered, he instructed his choir in Jena to sing the hymn each week \"at his front door. to make it better known\". Rodigast studied first at the Gymnasium in Weimar and then at the University of Jena, where from 1676 he held an adjunct position in philosophy. In 1680 Rodigast was appointed vice-rector of the Gymnasium zum Grauen Kloster in Berlin, eventually becoming rector in 1698. In the interim he had refused offers of a professorship at Jena and school rectorships elsewhere. He was closely associated with the founder and leader of the pietist movement, Philipp Jakob Spener, who moved to Berlin in 1691 and remained there until his death in 1705. In his 1721 book on the lives of famous lyric poets, Johann Caspar Wetzel reports that already by 1708 Rodigast's hymn had acquired the reputation as a \"hymnus suavissimus & per universam fere Evangelicorum ecclesiam notissimus,\" i.e. as one of the most beautiful and widely known church hymns. The text of the hymn was first published  without melody in G\u00f6ttingen in 1676 in an appendix to the Hannoverische Gesangbuch (Hanover songbook). It was published with the melody in 1690 in the N\u00fcrnbergische Gesangbuch (Nuremberg songbook). Rodigast's involvement with pietism is reflected in the hymn \"Was Gott tut, das ist wohgetan\", which is considered to be one of the earliest examples of a pietist hymn. The Encyclopedia Britannica describes it as \"one of the most exquisite strains of pious resignation ever written\". The opening phrase, \"Was Gott tut, das ist wohlgetan\", is a variant of \"Alles, was er tut, das ist recht,\" Luther's German version of \"all His ways are just\" from. The theme of the hymn is pious trust in God's will in times of adversity and tribulation: as  Unger writes, \"True piety is to renounce self and submit in quiet faith to God's providential acts despite suffering and poverty\". In the 1690 N\u00fcrnbergische Gesangbuch the hymn is listed under Klag- und Creuz- Lieder (hymns of mourning and the Cross). Despite the \"sick-bed\" narrative surrounding the composition of the hymn melody, there has been uncertainty as to whether Gastorius was involved in composing the original melody. On the other hand, it is known that the melody of the first half is the same as that of the hymn \"Frisch auf, mein Geist, sei wohlgemuth\" by Werner Fabricius (1633\u20131679), published by Ernst Christoph Homburg in Naumburg in 1659 in the collection Geistliche Lieder. Although the text of Rodigast's hymn was published without the melody in 1676 (in the Hannoverische Gesangbuch), it was discovered in the 1960s that already within three years the melody had been used in Jena for other hymn texts by Daniel Klesch. Educated at the University of Wittenberg, Klesch was a Hungarian pietist minister who, after the Protestant expulsions in Hungary, served during 1676\u20131682 as rector at the Raths-Schule in Jena where Gastorius acted as cantor. Klesch used the melody for two different hymn texts\u2014\"Brich an, verlangtes Morgenlicht\" and \"Der Tag, der ist so freudenreich\"\u2014in the And\u00e4chtige Elends-Stimme published by his brother Christoph Klesch in 1679. The Klesch hymnbook names four of the 44 hymn melodies it contains as being known and two as being composed by a king and a count; it describes the remaining 38\u2014without further precision\u2014as being written by Severus Gastorius and Johann Hancken, cantor in Strehlen in Silesia. The text and melody of Rodigast's hymn were published together for the first time in 1690 in the N\u00fcrnbergische Gesangbuch, with the composer marked as \"anonymous\". Before that the melody with the hymn title had already been used by Pachelbel for an organ partita in 1683. Taking into account the appearance of the melody in the Klesch hymnbook and the history of the hymn given in the 1687 Nordhausen Gesangbuch, the Swiss theologian and musicologist Andreas Marti has suggested that it is plausible that, as he lay on his sick-bed in Jena, the cantor Severus Gastorius had the melody of Fabricius spinning  around in his head as an \"earworm\" and was inspired to add a second half. In German-speaking countries, the hymn appears in the Protestant hymnal Evangelisches Gesangbuch as EG 372 and in the Catholic hymnal Gotteslob as GL 416. Like its sequel, each of the seven verses starts with the same incipit. The hymn was published in the 1648 Cantionale Sacrum, Gotha, to a melody of Caspar Cramer, first published in Erfurt in 1641. It is No. 2524 in the  German hymn catalogue of Johannes Zahn. In 1650 Samuel Scheidt composed a four part chorale prelude SSWV 536 on Altenburg's hymn in his G\u00f6rlitzer Tabulaturbuch. In the original German, the hymn has six stanzas, all beginning with the incipit \"\". Below are the first, fifth and last stanzas with the 1865 translation by Catherine Winkworth. First stanza and melody in 2/2 time as they appear in the 1690 N\u00fcrnbergische Gesangbuch. Rodigast's hymn and its melody have been set by many composers, one of the earliest being Pachelbel, who set it first, together with other hymn, in an organ partita Musicalische Sterbens-Gedancken (Musical thoughts on dying), published in Erfurt in 1683. The organ partita, originating \"in the devastating experience of the death of Pachelbel's family members during the plague in Erfurt\", reflects the use of \"Was Gott tut, das ist wohlgetan\" as a funeral hymn. He set the hymn later as a cantata, most likely in N\u00fcrnberg after 1695. Johann Sebastian Bach set the hymn several times in his cantatas: cantatas BWV 98, BWV 99 and BWV 100 take the name of the hymn, the last setting all six stanzas; while cantatas BWV 12, BWV 69 and BWV 144 include a chorale to the words of the first or last stanza; and he set the first stanza as the first in the set of three wedding chorales BWV 250\u2013252, for SATB, oboes, horns, strings and organ, intended for use in a wedding service instead of a longer cantata. For his inaugural cantata in Leipzig in 1723, Die Elenden sollen essen, BWV 75, Bach chose chorales on the fifth and last verses to end the two parts. Referring to contemporary disputes between orthodox Lutherans and Pietists,  has suggested that Bach's choice of a popular \"spiritual\" pietist hymn instead of a \"traditional\" Lutheran chorale might have been considered controversial. Indeed, before being appointed as Thomaskantor, Bach had been required by the Consistory in Leipzig to certify that he subscribed to the Formula of Accord,  and thus adhered to the orthodox doctrines of Luther., however, comments that, from what is known, \"Bach never let himself be drawn into the aggressive conflict between Kirchen- and Seelen-Music\u2014traditional church music on the one hand and music for the soul on the other\u2014which had a stifling effect on both sacred and secular musical life elsewhere in Germany\". Bach also set the hymn early in his career for organ as the chorale prelude BWV 1116 in the Neumeister Collection. The hymn title appears twice on empty pages in the autograph manuscript of Orgelb\u00fcchlein, where Bach listed the planned chorale preludes for the collection: the 111th entry on page 127 was to be the hymn of Altenburg; and the 112th entry on the next page was for Rodigast's hymn. Amongst Bach's contemporaries, there are settings by Johann Gottfried Walther as a chorale prelude and Georg Philipp Telemann as a cantata (TWV 1:1747). Bach's immediate predecessor as Thomaskantor in Leipzig, Johann Kuhnau, also composed a cantata based on the hymn. In addition Christoph Graupner composed four cantatas on the text between 1713 and 1743; and Gottfried Heinrich St\u00f6lzel set the text in his cantata Was Gott tut das ist wohlgetan, H. 389. Amongst Bach's pupils, Johann Peter Kellner, Johann Ludwig Krebs and Johann Philipp Kirnberger composed chorale preludes on the melody. In the nineteenth century, Franz Liszt used the hymn in several compositions. In 1862, following the death of his daughter Blandine, he wrote his Variations on a theme of J. S. Bach, S180 for piano based on Weinen, Klagen, Sorgen, Zagen, BWV 12, with its closing chorale on \"Was Gott tut, das ist wohlgetan\" on the penultimate page above which Liszt wrote the words of the chorale. describes the Variations as \"a wonderful vehicle for his grief\" and the Lutheran chorale as \"an unmistakable reference to the personal loss that he himself had suffered, and his acceptance of it\". The hymn also appeared as the sixth piece (for chorus and organ) in Liszt's Deutsche Kirchenlieder, S.669a (1878\u20131879)  and the first piece in his  Zw\u00f6lf alte deutsche geistliche Weisen, S.50 (1878\u20131879) for piano. It was also set in the first of the chorale preludes, Op. 93 by the French organist and composer Alexandre Guilmant. In 1902 Max Reger set the hymn as No. 44 in his collection of 52 Chorale Preludes, Op. 67. He also set it in 1914 as No. 16 of his 30 little chorale preludes for organ, Op. 135a. In 1915 Reger moved to Jena, one year before his untimely death. In Jena he played the organ in the Stadtkirche St. Michael and composed his Seven Pieces for Organ, Op. 145. The first piece, Trauerode, is dedicated to the memory of those who fell in the war during 1914\u20131915: initially darkly coloured, the mood gradually changes to one of peaceful resignation at the close, when the chorale Was Gott tut is heard. The second piece is entitled Dankpsalm and is dedicated \"to the German people\". It begins with brilliant toccata-like writing which alternates with darker more contemplative music. The piece contains settings of two Lutheran chorales: first, another version of \"Was Gott tut\"; and then, at the conclusion, \"Lobe den Herren\". According to, \"the acceptance of divine will in the first is answered by praise of the omnipotent God in the second, a commentary on the sacrifice of war in a Job-like perspective\". Sigfrid Karg-Elert included a setting in his 66 Chorale improvisations for organ, published in 1909.\n",

        "prefix": "Norte\u00f1o or Norte\u00f1a (, northern), also m\u00fasica norte\u00f1a, is a genre of Regional Mexican music from Northern Mexico,",
        "reference": " hence the name. The music is most often based on a polka or waltz tempo and its lyrics often deal with socially relevant topics. The accordion and the bajo sexto are traditional norte\u00f1o's most characteristic instruments. Norte\u00f1a music developed in the late 19th century, as a mixture between German folk music (which was introduced to Mexico with the arrival of German migrant workers in those years), and local Northern Mexican music. The genre is popular in both Mexico and the United States, especially among the Mexican and Mexican-American community, and it has become popular in many Latin American countries as far as Colombia, Chile, and Spain. Though originating from rural areas, norte\u00f1o is popular in both rural and urban areas. A conjunto norte\u00f1o is a type of Mexican folk ensemble. It mostly includes diatonic accordion, bajo sexto, electric bass or double bass, and drums, and sometimes saxophone. The norte\u00f1o repertoire covers canci\u00f3n ranchera, corrido, ballad, bolero, chot\u00eds, cumbia, huapango norte\u00f1o, mazurka, polka, redowa and waltz. Emperor Maximilian I brought music from Europe to M\u00e9xico. By 1864 he had accumulated marching bands and musicians to entertain him. When Maximilian's empire was defeated, many of his former army and fellow countrymen fled north and dispersed into what is now the southwestern United States. Norte\u00f1o music developed from a blending of Mexican and Spanish oral and musical traditions, military brass band instrumentation, and Germanic musical styles such as polka and waltz. European immigrants from Germany, Poland, and the Czech  Republic to northern Mexico and the southwestern United States also brought dance traditions such as the varsovienne. The focus on the accordion in the music of their home countries was integrated into Mexican music, and the instrument is essential in the genre today. It was called norte\u00f1o because it was most popular in the northern regions of Mexico. The late 1910s and 1920s were the golden age of the corrido, a form of ballad. Mexicans on both sides of the border came to San Antonio, Texas, to record in hotels. Their songs memorialize the Mexican political revolution of the time. Los Alegres de Ter\u00e1n and Los Donne\u00f1os were among the first norte\u00f1o bands. Later in the century, the genre became more commercial with the works of Los Rel\u00e1mpagos del Norte and other groups. More recent bands such as Intocable integrate elements of rock music and other popular styles. Modern norte\u00f1o has also diverged significantly from more original \"oldie\" norte\u00f1o of pre-1950s artists such as Narciso Mart\u00ednez. Since the 1970s and 1980s, electric bass guitars and a modern drum set have been added. The traditional bajo sexto-accordion style of Los Alegres de Ter\u00e1n and Antonio Aguilar transformed into the modern style typical to that of Los Tigres del Norte, Intocable, Duelo and Los Tucanes de Tijuana. Current songs may feature percussions, saxophone, or an electronic keyboard. In 2014, Los Tigres del Norte released the album Realidades, which contains the song \u201cEra Diferente\u201d (meaning \u201cShe Was Different\u201d) about a lesbian teenager who falls in love with her best friend; according to lead singer and songwriter Jorge Hern\u00e1ndez, this is the first time a norte\u00f1o band has ever written  a gay love song.\n",

        "prefix": "Eads Bridge is a combined road and railway bridge over the Mississippi River connecting the cities of St. Louis, Missouri and East St. Louis, Illinois. It",
        "reference": " is located on the St. Louis riverfront between Laclede's Landing, to the north, and the grounds of the Gateway Arch, to the south. The bridge is named for its designer and builder, James Buchanan Eads. Opened in 1874, Eads Bridge was the first bridge erected across the Mississippi south of the Missouri River. Earlier bridges were located north of the Missouri, where the Mississippi is smaller. None of the earlier bridges survive; Eads Bridge is the oldest bridge on the river. At 520 feet between the piers, the center arch of Eads Bridge was the longest rigid span ever built at the time of its construction (only a few suspension bridges had longer spans). It remained the longest rigid span until the completion of the 525 foot (160 meter) arch of Gustave Eiffel's Maria Pia Bridge, in Porto, Portugal, in 1877. Extending more than 100\u00a0ft below water level, the foundations for Eads Bridge were the deepest underwater constructions of their time. They were installed using pneumatic caissons, a pioneering application of caisson technology in the United States and, at the time, by far the largest caissons ever built. The Eads Bridge caissons were the model for subsequent projects including the Brooklyn Bridge which was constructed just a few years later. During construction, the partially-completed arches were suspended from above, on cables rigged to temporary wooden towers which were erected on top of the piers. This procedure avoided the need for temporary supports standing in the river and is sometimes cited as the first use of the \"cantilever principle\" for a large bridge. In addition to its age and size, Eads Bridge is noted for the material used in its construction. Much of the metal in the bridge is wrought iron but the primary load-carrying components of the arches were made from steel. This was the first large-scale application of steel as a structural material and initiated the shift from wrought-iron to steel as the default material for large structures. Eads Bridge became a famous image of the city of St. Louis, from the time of its erection until 1965 when the Gateway Arch was completed. It is still in use. The highway deck was closed to automobiles from 1991 to 2003, but has been restored and carries vehicular and pedestrian traffic. It connects Washington Avenue in St. Louis, Missouri with Riverpark Drive and, eventually, East Broadway, both in East St. Louis, Illinois. The former railroad deck now carries the St. Louis MetroLink light rail system, providing commuter train service between St Louis and communities on the Illinois side of the river. The bridge is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as a National Historic Landmark. As of April 2014, it carries about 8,100 vehicles daily, down 3,000 since the new Stan Musial Veterans Memorial Bridge opened in February 2014. City fathers wanted a wagon bridge to the heart of town to highlight the best features of St. Louis. Economics required that it be a railroad bridge, but there was no space for railroads in the heart of downtown. Hence, a tunnel was authorized to connect the bridge to the Missouri Pacific Railroad to the south (and later to the new Union Station). Eads worked out the specifications for the tunnel. It was to be a \u201ccut and cover\u201d tunnel 4000\u00a0ft long, 30\u00a0ft below street level. They advertised for bids in the Missouri Republican on August 31, 1872. The contract was awarded to William Skrainka and Company. Construction began in October. A series of problems arose including quicksand and springs on the planned route. Also several workers were injured; at least one was killed. On November 29, the city council passed an ordinance changing the tunnel route to Eight Street and transferring the right to build to the newly formed St. Louis Tunnel Railroad Company. In April, Skrainka and Co. decided the project was too difficult. They agreed to complete construction south of Market St.  The work north of Market was assigned to James Andrews, the company building the bridge piers. Eads Bridge was ready to be opened after seven years of construction on July 4, 1874. The celebration included a fifteen car train filled with 500 dignitaries pulled by three locomotives that departed from the St. Louis, Vandalia, and Terre Haute Railroad station in East St. Louis. Locomotives were provided by the Illinois Central Railroad and the Vandalia line (a Pennsylvania Railroad subsidiary). The route crossed Eads Bridge and traveled through the tunnel to Mill Creek Valley and then returned. Locomotive smoke is a concern in tunnels, especially passenger tunnels. Specially designed coke burning \u201csmoke consuming engines\u201d from the Baldwin Locomotive Works had yet to be ordered. News reports tell of passengers coughing and gasping for breath. Construction of the tunnel was not yet complete. Only one of the two tracks was available and ventilation was not yet arranged. A photograph of the St. Louis Bridge Company\u2019s coke burning engine appears on page 38 of Brown\u2019s Baldwin Locomotive Works. Many know of Manhattan Transfer where steam locomotives were changed to electric engines for the trip through the tunnels under the Hudson River (constructed in 1911 by the Pennsylvania Railroad, now part of Amtrak\u2019s Northeast Corridor Line) from New Jersey into New York City. Apparently St. Louis Bridge Company operated a similar transfer station in East St. Louis. In 1875, the bridge and tunnel companies declared bankruptcy. In 1881, Jay Gould got control of the bridge and tunnel companies by threatening to build a competing bridge four miles north of St. Louis. In 1889, Gould was instrumental in the creation of the Terminal Railroad Association of St. Louis. He died in 1892, but this led to the construction of Union Station in 1894. Eads Bridge and its tunnel are now used by Metrolink, the St. Louis light rail system. Eads Bridge was built by the Illinois and St. Louis Bridge Company, with the Keystone Bridge Company serving as subcontractor for superstructure erection. Because of the increased reach of newly constructed railroads, river shipping trade had declined in importance compared to the antebellum years. Chicago was fast gaining as the center of commerce in the West. The bridge was conceived as a solution for St. Louis to regain eminence by connecting railroad and vehicle transportation across the river. Although he had no prior experience in bridge building, James Eads was chosen as chief engineer for the bridge. In an attempt to secure their future, steamboat interests successfully lobbied to place restrictions on bridge construction, requiring spans and heights previously unheard of. This was ostensibly to maintain sufficient operating room for steamboats beneath the bridge's base for the then foreseeable future. The unproclaimed purpose was to require a bridge so grand and lofty that it was impossible to erect according to conventional building techniques. The steamboat parties planned to prevent any structure from being built, in order to ensure continued dependence on river traffic to sustain commerce in the region. Such a bridge required a radical design solution. The Mississippi River's strong current was almost  and the builders had to battle ice floes in the winter. The ribbed arch had been a known construction technique for centuries. The triple span, tubular metallic arch construction was supported by two shore abutments and two mid-river piers. Four pairs of arches per span (upper and lower) were set  apart, supporting an upper deck for vehicular traffic and a lower deck for rail traffic. Construction involved varied and confusing design elements and pressures. State and federal charters precluded suspension or draw bridges, or wood construction. There were constraints on span size and the height above the water line. The location required reconciling differences in heights - from the low Illinois floodplain of the east bank of the river to the high Missouri cliff on the west bank. The bedrock could only be reached by deep drilling, as it was 38 m below water level on the Illinois side and 26 m below on the Missouri side. These pressures resulted in a bridge noted as innovative for precision and accuracy of construction and quality control. This was the first use of structural alloy steel in a major building construction, through use of cast chromium steel components. The completed bridge also relied on significant\u2014and unknown\u2014amounts of wrought iron. Eads argued that the great compressive strength of steel was ideal for use in the upright arch design. His decision resulted from a curious combination of chance and necessity, due to the insufficient strength of alternative material choices. The particular physical difficulties of the site stimulated interesting solutions to construction problems. The deep caissons used for pier and abutment construction signaled a new chapter in civil engineering. Piers were sunk almost  below the river's surface. Unable to construct falsework to erect the arches, because they would obstruct river traffic, Eads's engineers devised a cantilevered rigging system to close the arches. Masonry piers were built to heights of almost, about the height of a ten-story building. About  of that span was driven through the sandy riverbed until it hit bedrock. Eads implemented a building method that he had observed in Europe, whereby masonry was set atop a metal chamber filled with compressed air. Stone was added to the chamber, which caused the caisson to sink. Workers dove into the caisson to shovel sand into a pump that shot it out into the air so the masonry could be sunk into the riverbed. Numerous workers who operated in the Eads Bridge caissons, still among the deepest ever sunk, suffered from \"caisson disease\" (also known as \"the bends\" or decompression sickness). Fifteen workers died, two other workers were permanently disabled, and 77 were severely afflicted. Eads Bridge was recognized as an innovative and exciting achievement. Eads secured 47 patents during his lifetime, many of which were taken out for parts of the bridge's structure and devices for its construction. President Ulysses S. Grant dedicated the bridge on July 4, 1874, and General William T. Sherman drove the gold spike completing construction. After completion, 14 locomotives crossed the bridge to prove its stability. On June 14, 1874, John Robinson led a \"test elephant\" on a stroll across the new Eads Bridge to prove that it was safe. A big crowd cheered as the elephant from a traveling circus lumbered toward Illinois. Popular belief held that elephants had instincts that would make them avoid setting foot on unsafe structures. Two weeks later, Eads sent 14 locomotives back and forth across the bridge at one time. The opening day celebration on July 4, 1874, featured a parade that stretched for  through the streets of St. Louis. The cost of building the bridge was nearly $10\u00a0million ($\u00a0million with inflation). The Eads Bridge was undercapitalized during construction and burdened with debt. Because of its historic focus on the Mississippi and river trade, St. Louis lacked adequate rail terminal facilities, and the bridge was poorly planned to coordinate rail access. Although an engineering and aesthetic success, the bridge operations became bankrupt within a year of opening. The railroads boycotted the bridge, resulting in a loss of tolls. The bridge was later sold at auction for 20 cents on the dollar. This sale caused the National Bank of the State of Missouri to fold, which was the largest bank failure in the United States at that time. Eads did not suffer financial consequences. Many involved with financing the bridge were indicted, but Eads was not. Granite for the bridge came from the Iron County, Missouri, quarry of B. Gratz Brown, Missouri Governor and U.S. Senator, who had helped secure federal financing for the bridge. In April 1875, after the failure of the Illinois and St Louis Bridge Company, the bridge was sold at public auction, for $2 million, to a newly incorporated St. Louis Bridge Company controlled by the old company's creditors. This group was bought-out two years later by the Terminal Railroad Association of St. Louis (TRRA). The TRRA owned the bridge until 1989, when the Terminal Railroad transferred the bridge to the Bi-State Regional Transportation Authority and the City of St. Louis, for incorporation into St Louis' MetroLink light rail system. In exchange for Eads Bridge, the TRRA acquired the MacArthur Bridge, previously owned by the City of St Louis. In 1949, the bridge's strength was tested with electromagnetic strain gauges. It was determined that Eads' original estimation of an allowable load of  could be raised to. The Eads Bridge is still considered one of the greatest bridges ever built. Eads Bridge had long hosted only passenger trains on its rail deck. In the late 20th century, however, passenger traffic had declined because of individual automobile use, and the railroad industry was restructuring. By the 1970s, the Terminal Railroad Association had abandoned its Eads trackage. The bridge had lost all remaining passenger rail traffic to the MacArthur Bridge during the early years of Amtrak; the dimensions of modern passenger diesels were incompatible with both the bridge and the adjoining tunnel linking the Union Station trackage with Eads. MetroLink service over the bridge began in 1993. The bridge was closed to automobile traffic between 1991 and 2003, when the city of St. Louis, Missouri, completed a project to restore the highway deck. In 1998, the Naval Facilities Engineering Service Center investigated the effects of the ramming of the bridge by the towboat Anne Holly on April 4 of that year. The ramming resulted in the near breakaway of the SS Admiral, a riverboat casino. Implementing several recommended changes reduced the odds of this happening in the future. In 1898 the bridge was featured on the $2 Trans-Mississippi Issue of postage stamps. One hundred years later the design was reprinted in a commemorative souvenir sheet. The bridge was designated as a National Historic Landmark in 1964, in recognition of its innovations in design, materials, construction methods, and importance in the history of large-scale engineering projects. During the bridge's construction, The New York Times called it The World's Eighth Wonder. On its 100th anniversary, the Times' architectural critic, Ada Louise Huxtable, described it as \"among the most beautiful works of man\".\n",

The specific epithet \"cacaofunesta\" means \"cacao-killing\". Two closely related sublineages exist within this species, one centered in western Ecuador and the other containing isolates from Brazil, Colombia and Costa Rica. The disease known as \"Ceratocystis wilt of cacao\" (or \"Mal de machete\") is a serious disease of the cocoa tree (Theobroma cacao) in Latin America. The fungus is indigenous to Central and South America. This fungus is able to penetrate cacao trees through stem wounds that are caused either by insects or through infected cutting tools. Wounds made by harvesting pods, removing stem sprouts or weeding may become infected. The disease is a systemic infection that damages the entire plant. The fungus enters its host through the xylem, causing a deep stain leading to the obstruction of water and nutrient transport. It moves systemically through the plant. Eventually, the plant turns yellow and then brown, leading to wilting and the sudden death of the tree. The disease has been of major importance in Costa Rica, Trinidad and Tobago, Ecuador, parts of Colombia and Venezuela. In the 1990s, C. cacaofunesta was introduced to the southern region of Bahia, which is the largest Brazilian cacao-producing state. This disease is responsible for reductions in the cacao population in plantation areas, which has resulted in great economic losses in the affected regions. The fungus has killed as many as half of the trees in some locations.\n",

Despite this confirmation, the Korean Grand Prix was not included on any of the provisional 2010 calendars released by Formula One Management. Following approval of funding for the event, Korea was given the date of 17 October on the 2010 calendar published by the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) on 21 September 2009. On 10 December 2009, the organisers of the event announced that they were on schedule, with a plan to finish the circuit on 5 July 2010, though they admitted that their largest problem lay in finding accommodation for all Formula One staff and spectators. The organisers also ruled out the possibility of staging the race at night until they have more knowledge of and experience in running a Grand Prix. Despite all the confirmation there was still a risk that the circuit might not be on time, however this was denied by the race promoter who said that the circuit was ahead of schedule. After several postponements, the FIA scheduled a final inspection of the circuit on 11 October 2010, 13 days before the Korean Grand Prix was scheduled to begin. After the FIA inspection, Race Director Charlie Whiting declared that the race would go ahead. In 2011, organisers of the Korean Grand Prix expressed dissatisfaction over the terms of their contract with Bernie Ecclestone and Formula One Management, particularly with regards to the cost of race-sanctioning fees, and sought to renegotiate the contract, seeking more-favourable terms. However, Ecclestone ruled out renegotiations, stating that the initial negotiation process had been difficult enough, and that the organisers were aware of the terms of the contract when they first signed it. Ecclestone has stated that in the event that race organisers could not pay sanctioning fees, the Korean Grand Prix would be removed from the calendar. The final calendar, released in December 2011, kept the Korean Grand Prix. After the 2012 Australian Grand Prix, organisers of the race in Korea announced that they had reached a new deal with Formula One Management that would save $20. 5 million (\u20a923 billion) in costs. Kang Hyo-seok, director of race organisation for the Korean Grand Prix, admitted that the race was still 'too expensive' for Korea, anticipating an estimated loss of $26 million (\u20a929 billion) in 2012. The race went ahead in 2013. A preliminary calendar for the 2014 season listed a provisional date for the Korean Grand Prix, but the race was omitted from the final calendar for 2014. Initially, the race was not included in the provisional 2015 calendar, a later calendar released in December 2014, gave the Korean Grand Prix a slot on 3 May 2015, having been moved from towards the end of the calendar in previous years, towards the start of the calendar. On 12 December 2014 Bernie Ecclestone said that Korean Grand Prix had to be added to 2015 calendar for legal reasons, citing contract obligations, but that organizers were not keen on having the race. Later it was announced that it had been removed from the calendar by the FIA because the organisers did not wish to host it. They had plans to revive the Korean Grand Prix in 2016, but these also failed to materialise. All Korean Grands Prix were held at Yeongam.\n",

It was subject to a controversial public enquiry which eventually granted the land Village green status in November 2008.

It was named after the war poet from Oswestry Wilfred Owen due to his affection for nature and children. Shropshire Council\u2019s Conservation and Community Officer was able to acquire \u00a390,000 of extra funding allowing the budget to expand to \u00a3170,000. The rest of the funding came from other sources, including Natural England\u2019s Natural Assets, Play England, and Advantage West Midlands. The council announced the site \"will be a haven to both residents and wildlife\". The area of green space includes formal design at one end, gently blending into a more natural area of wildflower meadows, woodland, imaginative areas of mounds and hollows, log and boulder piles and one of the largest labyrinths worldwide. The wildflower meadows are great for wildlife such as bees, and butterflies, a small orchard and new hedges have been established which will provide birds with food, and shelter. In the future the ecology of this area will be observed, and to allow to biodiversity to improve and fulfil its potential. Plans are to allow the site to become even wilder and therefore better for wildlife, and will eventually blend in with the Shelf Bank Site (a future Local Nature Reserve) which is situated next to Wilfred Owen Green.\n",

In addition to the ASL, the Lions hope to form a women's team that would rival the Lancaster Inferno of the United Women's Soccer for local talent. in March of 2019, AFC Lancaster Lions joined the UPSL, a nationally recognized semi-professional soccer league to begin play for the 2019 spring season. The Lions are a member of the Northeast Conference - American Division of the UPSL Championship. The colors of the AFC Lancaster Lions are red, blue, yellow, and white. The crest features the motto, Unos pro omnibus, ones pro uno (sic. ), a Latin phrase meaning, \"One for all, all for one\". The heraldic imagery of a lion, a red rose, and the contour of the shield likely recall traditional English insignia. For example, the Royal Arms of England features a red shield charged with three golden lions on display, with blue as an accent color. The Pennsylvania city of Lancaster was named for Lancaster, Lancashire, England, whose official symbol was the Red Rose of Lancaster. The soccer balls arranged at the top of the crest are also English in style, with outlines similar to those found on the shield for Manchester United F.C., a renowned Premier League club. The logo also includes two crossed hickory logs, a more local reference since Lancaster city was first named \"Hickory Town\". The design also shares many elements in common with the civic flag of Lancaster, Pennsylvania, itself featuring two red roses and English royalty colors.

After successfully defeating the Austrian right wing at the Battle of Montenotte, Napoleon Bonaparte continued with his plan to separate the Austrian army of General Johann Beaulieu from the army of the Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia led by General Michelangelo Colli. By taking the defences at Dego, the French would control the only road by which the two armies could link with each other. The town's defences comprised both a castle on a bluff and earthworks on rising ground, and were held by a small mixed force, consisting of units of both the Austrian and Piedmont-Sardinian armies. On 14 April, Andr\u00e9 Mass\u00e9na, leading Am\u00e9d\u00e9e Laharpe's division and one brigade of Jean-Baptiste Meynier's division attacked the town. The French overran the defences, losing about 1,500 killed and wounded. The Austrians suffered 3,000 casualties, including a large number of prisoners. Argenteau's survivors fled northeast to the town of Acqui Terme. Bonaparte ordered Meynier to hold Dego, while he took Laharpe's division west to fight Colli's Sardinians. However, the French troops in Dego then gave themselves over to looting, and during the night they were mostly scattered in the nearby houses. At dawn on 15 April, under cover of fog, the defences were counter-attacked by an Austrian force under Colonel Josef Vukassovich. Beaulieu planned for Vukassovich to reinforce Argenteau the day before, but his orders were poorly written and his subordinate showed up at Dego a day too late. Nevertheless, taken by surprise, the French were rapidly driven out of Dego and back to their starting point of the day before. Allegedly, the surprise attack caught Mass\u00e9na in bed with a woman and he escaped in his nightshirt. Mass\u00e9na took some time to take control of the situation again. He recalled Laharpe and organised a counter-attack, which was supported by other reinforcements brought up by Bonaparte. Vukassovich's force was heavily outnumbered, and was unable to defend for long before it was driven out, leaving Dego definitively in French hands. The second day's action cost the Austrians a further 670 killed and wounded, plus 1,087 captured. The Preiss Infantry Regiment # 24 took particularly heavy losses. The French lost 621 killed and wounded, and 317 captured. The second day surprise made Bonaparte anxious that Beaulieu might intervene from the east, so the French general reorganized his forces and sent out strong patrols on 16 April. But Argenteau's mauling at Montenotte and Dego shook Beaulieu's nerve and he stayed near Acqui. Satisfied that Beaulieu was out of the picture, Bonaparte turned on Colli with his main strength on 17 April. On 21 April, The French beat Colli at the Battle of Mondov\u00ec and soon afterward the Sardinian government sued for peace.\n",

After shakedown off Norfolk, Rail was assigned to Little Creek, Virginia, to evaluate new underwater mine-locating sonar equipment. In March 1953 she was ordered to U.S. Naval Mine Countermeasures Station in Panama City, Florida, for further sonar evaluation, returning to Little Creek in December. In June 1954 Rail was ordered to Coco Solo, Canal Zone, and placed under operational control of the Commandant, 15th Naval District. On 7 February 1955, she was reclassified as a coastal minehunter (MHC-37). She operated out of Coco Solo and Guantanamo Bay, putting into Norfolk briefly on 11 June 1956.

        "reference": ", noted for writing Les Honneurs de la Cour, an account of precedence and ceremony at Burgundian Court, and based on her own experiences of court-life. Ali\u00e9nor was the daughter of the nobleman, Jean de Poitiers of Champagne and Isabel de Sousa, a member of an illegitimate line of the royal house of Portugal. Her parents were both members of the court of the Duke Philip the Good and Isabella of Portugal, Duchess of Burgundy. Her mother had come to Flanders in 1429 as part of Isabella's retinue and was acutely aware of the differences between the Portuguese Court and the Burgundian Court. Ali\u00e9nor was raised in the court and from the age of 7, served alongside her mother who at the time was the highest ranked ladies in waiting to Isabella. Ali\u00e9nor became a demoiselle d'honneur to Isabella of Bourbon in 1458. In 1462, she married Guillame de Stavele, the Vicount of Veurne (d. 1469). She and Guillame had three children; a boy, Guillaume (1465-1474), and two daughters Adrienne (1467-1525) and Antoine (1469- 1494). She became a widow at around the age of 25 years, just nine years after her marriage. She never remarried. In 1496, she was appointed dame d'honneur to the new duchess of Burgundy, Joan I of Navarre, following her marriage to Phillip the Fair. She died on 14 March 1509, at the age of around 65 years, and was buried at her husband's side in the Stavele Parish Church. An acute observer, and stickler for protocol, Ali\u00e9nor de Poitiers committed matters of court etiquette to writing between 1484 and 1491. Her work was later published as Les Honneurs de la Cour (Honors of the Court)  The book gives the structures and rules of court ritual and the etiquette appropriate to different social classes and situations. She was particularly interested in the conventions observed when ladies of various ranks were lying in the birthing chamber. The book gives a description of the court life of the Duchy of Burgundy, at the time renowned as the most developed and refined in all Europe outside of Italy. A notable feature of the work is its account of the importance of women in memory and transmitting ritual conduct in court-life. Although she originally intended her publication to be used as an instructional manual, it has become a valuable historical source. Written during the political vacuum following the death of Duke Phillip's successor, Ali\u00e9nor was aware that strict court protocols were changing. She feared that the younger generation were forgetting court rules and wanted to preserve the rigid Burgundian arrangements of perfect courtesy, where everyone knew their place. She lamented that the \"old rules have been  changed in certain places. but that cannot degrade or abolish such ancient honours and estates, which were made and formed after much thought and for good reason\". The book was based on her first-hand observations of courtly life at the Burgundian court. However, she also drew on her mother's experience as lady-in-waiting to Isabella of Portugal, Duchess of Burgundy. In addition to her own observations, she gives those of her mother, and those of another noble lady, Jeanne d'Harcourt, married in 1391 to the Count William de Namur. She had been considered the best authority on court etiquette in the kingdom of France. The resulting collection of the customs of the court forms a kind of family diary embracing three generations, and extending back over more than a century.

Fox was an important figure in post-minimal sculpture, conceptual art, performance, and video art on the West Coast. Before permanently moving to Europe, he was based in San Francisco in the late 1960s and 1970s. Fox later moved to Liege, Belgium. His seminal series of works (environments, performances, sculptures, drawings) produced over an eight-year period was based on the theme of the configuration of the Chartres Labyrinth. He died in Cologne, Germany in 2008. Fox has been included in numerous international solo and group exhibitions including the documenta 5, Kassel, 1975 Whitney Biennial and 1984 Venice Biennale. He had two major exhibitions in Berkeley, his first solo museum show curated by Brenda Richardson in 1973, and one in 1985 organized around the body of works owned by the Berkeley Art Museum organized by Constance Lewallen. His retrospective solo exhibition was organized by the Kunsthalle Fridericianum, Kassel in 2003.

They sell a range of products, such as books, magazines, tobacco, ready meals, snacks, soft drinks and alcoholic drinks such as beer and cider, excluding wine and spirits. R-kioski shops also provide services such as the various \"Veikkaus\" games, prepaid mobile phone top-up vouchers, and fishing licences, as well as the sale of public transport tickets. Selected shops are also able to sell national rail and bus transport tickets. R-kioski is known as \"\u00c4rr\u00e4\" (the name of the letter R in Finnish) in common language. The company slogan is \"Nopeaa ja mukavaa on asiointi\" (It's swift and convenient to shop). The first R-kiosk in Estonia opened in 1993, and  there are 107 shops in Estonia. Reitan Convenience posted a turnover of 1. 63 billion Euros in 2017. Reitan Convenience invested 18 million Euros in R-kioski in 2013 and 2014 together. The money was invested to broaden the product selection as well as to lower the price of food to par with other retail chains competing in the same market such as Alepa and Siwa. The company dates back to 1910. The business was originally conceived by several major Finnish publishing houses as a newsagent for railway stations (\"Rautakirja\" was itself shortened from \"Rautatiekirjakauppa\" which translates to \"railway bookshop\"). It was later extended to other venues and products. The name R-kioski was adopted in 1958. On 5 March 2012, it was announced that the Reitan Group bought R-kioski from Sanoma for roughly 130 million Euros. The group had been working on the purchase for a decade, but previous negotiations had stranded as R-kioski had demanded a merger where they owned 51 percent. The purchase brought the Reitan Group to 2,500 kiosk outlets, making it the second-largest kiosk group in Europe. The company operated also in Romania, but sold operations to R-kioski Romania CEO Dan Vasile in 2011. The name R-kioski was to be abandoned in Romania after a grace period following the corporate acquisition. Former company slogans include \"Kaiken lis\u00e4ksi l\u00e4hell\u00e4\" (To top it off, it's near by), \"\u00c4kki\u00e4 R-kioskille\" (Swiftly to R-kioski),  \"R-kioskilla kaikki k\u00e4y\" (We accept everything at R-kioski or Everyone visits R-kioski) and \"R-Kioski \u2014 Sellaisena kuin sin\u00e4 haluat\" (R-Kioski \u2014 as you want it).\n",

It was acknowledged in Gebhard's New York Times obituary that Kinsey was in fact his mentor and that Gebhard was fascinated when Kinsey first met him and revealed to him that the men's room at Grand Central Terminal in New York City was a frequent site for gay cruising. Following Kinsey's death in 1956, Gebhard became the second director of the Kinsey Institute and served in that capacity from 1956 to 1982. In 1953, Gebhard co-authored the second of the two Kinsey Reports, which as known as \"Sexual Behavior in the Human Female\". He has also claimed that the statistical bias in the data had not materially affected the results of either of the two reports. He joined the Department of Anthropology of Indiana University in 1947, and retired in 1986. Paul Gebhard was born to Paul Gebhard, Sr. and Eva Baker, who worked as an elementary schoolteacher. He married and later divorced Agnes West, and was married to Joan Huntington until her death in 2004. Following a brief illness, Gebhard died near his home in Indiana on July 9, 2015, aged 98.

        "prefix": "Barrhead  (, ) is a town in East Renfrewshire, Scotland,  south-west of Glasgow city centre on the edge of the",
        "reference": " Gleniffer Braes. At the 2011 census its population was 17,268. In 2007, Reader's Digest magazine voted East Renfrewshire the second best place in the United Kingdom to raise a family. The magazine visited and cited Barrhead in their decision. Barrhead was formed when a series of small textile-producing villages (Barrhead, Arthurlie, Grahamston and Gateside) gradually grew into one another to form one contiguous town. According to local historian James McWhirter, the name \"Barrhead\" first appeared in 1750. Glanderston House, to the south, at one time  belonged to the Stewart Kings of Scotland. In 1851 an explosion at the Victoria Pit colliery in nearby Nitshill occurred, killing 63 men and boys who worked in the mine, many of whom lived in Barrhead. The victims were buried in a mass grave in the yard at St John's Church on Darnley Road, and although were later exhumed to other cemeteries, some may still reside at St John's in an unmarked grave. In 1890, with a rapidly expanding population approaching 10,000, various local residents formed a Barrhead Burgh Formation Committee. The status of police burgh was granted in 1894 and William Shanks, proprietor of a local company, was elected as the first provost of Barrhead. During the 19th and early 20th century, the town was a major centre for manufacturing, with industries including an iron foundry, tannery, and the Armitage Shanks porcelainware works, as well as Gaskell's carpet factory, employing generations of the town's residents. In the latter 20th century, the decline and closure of nearly all of these industries caused a fall in local population and employment. In recent years, Barrhead has found new life as a popular residential commuter town for near Paisley and Glasgow. During World War II, a handful of bombs fell on Barrhead from German planes headed towards Clydebank and Yoker. In 1894 Barrhead became a Burgh of Barony, meaning that it had its own town Council. This status was withdrawn in 1975 at the time of the institution of Strathclyde Regional Council and Renfrew District Council. Subsequent reorganisation to a single tier local authority in 1996 placed Barrhead under the auspices of East Renfrewshire Council. Barrhead is a single council ward, electing 4 members to serve as part of East Renfrewshire Council. Barrhead is part of the county constituency of East Renfrewshire, electing one MP to the House of Commons of the United Kingdom Parliament. Kirsten Oswald of the SNP was elected to represent East Renfrewshire in 2019 UK General Election. For purposes of the Scottish Parliament, Barrhead forms part of the Renfrewshire South Constituency, represented by Tom Arthur of the Scottish National Party. In addition to this Barrhead is represented by seven regional MSPs from the West of Scotland electoral region. Barrhead forms part of the Greater Glasgow conurbation. Areas within the town include, Arthurlie, Auchenback, Gateside and Grahamston. The town is about  from the edge of the Glasgow urban area itself (Hurlet and Parkhouse neighbourhoods), separated by farmland and countryside, much of which is now part of the Dams to Darnley Country Park encompassing the Balgray and Waulkmill Glen Reservoirs and thecourse of the Brock Burn. Major businesses within the town include Barrhead Travel, Kelburn Brewing Company, and JM Murdoch & Son, among others. The town's largest employer remains East Renfrewshire Council and the public sector. In 2002, part of the administration of East Renfrewshire Council relocated from Eastwood Park to Barrhead Main Street. There is a range of retail goods available within Barrhead, although some residents still rely on Paisley and the nearby Silverburn Shopping Centre in Glasgow for the bulk of their purchases. The town has three supermarkets. Tesco is located just outside the town centre while, with Lidl closeby. Asda opened a store on Main Street in 2014. East Renfrewshire Council has committed nearly \u00a3100 million to a masterplan which will redevelop and modernise Barrhead's economy between 2007 and 2017. The Glasgow Road corridor is being redeveloped into a dedicated business district which includes Crossmill Business Park, Blackbyres Court, and the former Bowerwalls housing area. There are four industrial estates: Robertson Street Industrial Estate, Levern Industrial Estate at Cogan Street, Muriel Street, and the Barrhead Cargo Centre and Shanks Industrial Park, located on the former site of the Armitage Shanks factory. In 2005 local businesses created the Barrhead Business Forum, which liaises with East Renfrewshire Council, Barrhead Community Council, and East Renfrewshire Chamber of Commerce. The administration and collection of business rates for Barrhead is undertaken by Renfrewshire Council. The national rate for business rates set by the Scottish Executive for 2007\u20132008 is 44. 1p per pound. In October 2016, Barrhead businesses voted in favour of becoming a Business Improvement District (BID), which is a model proving successful for town centres across the UK and beyond. The Barrhead BID is called 'All About Barrhead' and is the third BID in East Renfrewshire, following Giffnock which established in 2013 and Clarkston which is now in its second term, establishing in 2010. East Renfrewshire Credit Union is based in Barrhead. The town is part of the NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde Health Board. The nearest accident and emergency  unit is located at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley. Barrhead is accessible via Junction 2 (Pollok) or Junction 3 (Darnley) of the M77 motorway. Local bus services, McGill's Bus Services, travel from Barrhead to Glasgow, Paisley, Neilston, and Newton Mearns. Barrhead railway station, which serves the town, is on the Glasgow South Western Line. Trains from Barrhead run north-east to Glasgow Central and south to Kilmarnock, Stranraer, and Carlisle. At the beginning of the 20th century, several railway lines ran through Barrhead to accommodate the town's manufacturing industries: the Glasgow Barrhead and Neilston Direct Railway and the Glasgow and Kilmarnock Joint Railway, which merged to become the Glasgow, Barrhead and Kilmarnock Joint Railway; the Glasgow & South Western Railway, which built Barrhead Central railway station as the terminus of its short-lived Barrhead branch; and the Caledonian Railway. Evidence of these lines can still be seen within the town, including two standalone sections of railway viaduct, one near the Tesco store and the other now carrying a footpath between Springhill Road and the Woodside Park in Upper Auchenback (known locally as the Jerries). Barrhead was formerly served by routes 14 and 28 of the once extensive Glasgow Corporation Tramways system. Trams ran from Barrhead to Glasgow and Paisley. Glasgow tram service 14 was once the longest in Great Britain, running from Milngavie on the far north-western edge of Greater Glasgow, through the city centre and then through Thornliebank, Spiersbridge, Barrhead and Paisley to reach Renfrew Ferry on the south side of the Clyde. Tramway services in Paisley and Barrhead were withdrawn in 1957; the entire system was dismantled by September 1962. Barrhead has five primary schools: Carlibar Primary School, Cross Arthurlie Primary School, Hillview School, St. John's Roman Catholic Primary School and St. Mark's Roman Catholic Primary School. In 2007, St. Mark's received an outstanding report from HM Inspectorate of Education with 11 \"excellents\"\u00a0\u2013 the most ever recorded by HMIE\u00a0\u2013 making St. Mark's officially the best school in Scotland. The new Carlibar Primary School, opened in the autumn of 2006 to replace an outdated building, hosts a family centre, a pre-school assessment unit, community and adult learning services, and a state-of-the-art language and communication unit which serves nearly 50 children with autism from across East Renfrewshire. The town has two secondary schools: St. Luke's High School and Barrhead High, both located in the Auchenback area. St. Luke's High School was named a School of Ambition by the Scottish Executive. A new further education unit, East Renfrewshire College, is planned for the town centre. The Royal Shakespeare Company has staged full performances in Barrhead five times, most recently \"The Canterbury Tales\" in 2006, using a mobile performance venue set up in Barrhead Sports Centre. There are several public houses in Barrhead. These include Cross Stobs, The Kelburn, The Arthurlie Inns, The Fereneze Inn, and The Brig Inn. The Cross Stobs dates back to at least 1695. An active Scottish Junior football team, Arthurlie, plays in Barrhead, with a previous club of the same name having played as a senior league side until 1929. The earlier team was renowned for its 4-2 defeat of  Celtic in the 1897 Scottish Cup. Arthurlie's Johnny Kelly went on to play for Celtic and Barnsley and won several caps for Scotland. The team won the Scottish Junior Cup in 1998. Alex McLeish, Scotland's most capped defender with 77 caps and national team coach, went to school in Barrhead. In the early 20th century, the town produced three brothers, Alec Logan, James Logan and Tommy Logan who all played for either Scotland or the Scottish League XI. Barrhead Boys Club, founded in 1972 was recently renamed as Barrhead Youth Football club, caters for children as young as 6 years old up to 21 and also has adult and veteran teams. Barrhead is also home to the following bowling clubs: Barrhead, Arthurlie, Shanks, and St John's; and also the Fereneze Golf Club and Barrhead Community Tennis Club. Barrhead Boxing Club has produced several contenders at Scottish Amateur level as well as several professional contenders in recent years, while the towns several Muay Thai club's has produced some notable championship fighters. A greyhound racing track, was opened on ground off the Aurs Road on Saturday 7 July 1934. The racing was independent (not affiliated to the sports governing body the National Greyhound Racing Club) known as a flapping track, which was the nickname given to independent tracks. The track raced over 300 and 325 yards. The date of closure is not known. Major churches in Barrhead include St. John the Evangelist Roman Catholic Church on Aurs Road, the Church of Scotland parish churches at Bourock, Arthurlie and South & Levern, and the United Reformed Church on Arthurlie Street. There is also a Methodist church and several small evangelical churches. There is also a small Church of God in Barrhead.\n",

Around the same time, Wilson was offered a scholarship to attend Basketball Australia's Centre of Excellence (COE) at the Australian Institute of Sport in Canberra. Wilson chose to forgo the NAB AFL Level 1 scholarship and accepted Basketball Australia's COE scholarship. Wilson played for Basketball Australia's COE in the South East Australian Basketball League (SEABL) in 2014 and 2015. There were a number of US colleges looking at Wilson after he played well for Australia's under-17 side when they almost beat USA in the gold medal game at the 2014 FIBA Under-17 World Championship.

A week later, he was named SEABL Player of the Week for Round 7. On 10 June 2018, he was named Player of the Month for May. At the season's end, he was named the SEABL MVP alongside All-SEABL First Team and Australian Youth Player of the Year. On 19 April 2018, Wilson signed a 'one plus one' deal with the Sydney Kings, with the club holding the option on a second year. The Kings took up that option on 29 March 2019, but on 8 April, he made the decision to cut ties with basketball and join the ranks of Australian rules football.

Paul Kelly started recording his tenth studio album, Deeper Water, in September 1994. Two months earlier he had released his previous studio album, Wanted Man, which includes a track co-produced and co-written with Randy Jacobs (member of Was (Not Was)). For Deeper Water, Kelly and Jacobs co-wrote the title track; and they produced and wrote two further tracks, \"Extra Mile\" and \"I've Been a Fool\". Kelly used Kerryn Tolhurst (ex-The Dingoes) as producer for \"Difficult Woman\" and co-produced with him on \"Give in to My Love\". A third co-producer, Simon Polinski (Yothu Yindi), worked on a track, \"Gathering Storm\", which Kelly had co-written with Mart Saarelaht (leader of Jex Saarelaht Trio).

Another track, \"Difficult Woman\", was written for, and recorded by, Ren\u00e9e Geyer on her album of the same name, which had been produced by Kelly and was released in August 1994. Geyer later used the title for her autobiography, Confessions of a Difficult Woman (April 2000). In May 1995 Kelly formed a touring backing band with Jacobs on guitar; Stephen Hadley on bass guitar; Bruce Haymes on keyboards; Graham Lee on lap and pedal steel; and Peter Luscombe on drums. They played a series of sets at the Esplanade Hotel, their performance on 25 May was recorded live for Live at the Continental and the Esplanade (late 1995). Kelly issued Deeper Waters lead single, \"Give in to My Love\", in October 1995 and followed with \"Deeper Water\" later that year. To promote the releases he toured Australia from January in the following year. The Canberra Times Sharon Palmer noticed that \"No real surprises or sounds appear on Deeper Water, however a number of songs are notable for the absence of back-up singers on them with Kelly providing all the vocals\". William Ruhlmann of AllMusic opined that Kelly used \"a more consistent musical style than he had employed on Wanted Man\". Ruhlmann continued \"most of the songs had folk-rock arrangements, and most concerned romantic subjects, within which Kelly's primary concerns were lust and betrayal\". Mark Mordue writing in The Sydney Morning Herald felt that \"the songs from Deeper Water have become part of our lives\" displaying Kelly's \"poet of the common man credentials are built on both good writing and accuracy\". Mordue expanded by describing its \"take on family, growing older and love also has a dark edge to it, something in the territory around the songs, that gives the album an unusual intensity and warmth\". Deeper Water peaked at No. 40 on the ARIA Albums Chart and provided his second consecutive nomination as Best Male Artist at the ARIA Music Awards of 1996.

Verticordia subulata is a shrub which grows to a height of  and a width of. There is usually a single branch at the base and no lignotuber. The leaves are linear in shape, pointed,  long whilst those near the flowers are shorter. The flowers are lightly scented and are arranged in corymb-like groups on erect stalks from  long. The floral cup is top-shaped, about  long, ribbed, slightly wary and glabrous. The sepals are yellow, turning deep red with age, about  long, with 8 to 10 densely hairy lobes. The petals are a similar colour to the sepals, about  long and have long, pointed, finger-like projections. The style is  long, straight and glabrous. Flowering time is from September to October. Verticordia subulata was first formally described by Alex George in 1991 from specimens collected from the Stirling Range National Park by Alex and Elizabeth George. The description was published in Nuytsia. The specific epithet (subulata) is derived from the Latin word subula meaning \"an awl\" referring to the shape of the staminodes. George placed this species in subgenus Chrysoma, section Chrysoma along with V. citrella, V. endlicheriana and V. acerosa. This verticordia occurs in the area between the Beaufort River, Kalgan, Lake King and the Stirling Range National Park, in the Avon Wheatbelt, Esperance Plains, Jarrah Forest and Mallee biogeographic regions. It grows in clay and sand, sometimes over laterite soils, on flats and rises in heath, shrubland and open woodland. Verticordia subulata is classified as \"not threatened\" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife. This ornamental shrub can be propagated from cuttings, provided they are taken from late in spring. It is slow growing and needs to be in well-drained soil in a sunny position to avoid fungal attack.\n",

        "reference": " on January 5, 2012 and ended on April 11, 2013. It aired as part of Teletoon's \"Can't Miss Thursdays\" block. The series was produced by Cookie Jar Entertainment. Mudpit follows the adventures of four teens who form the eponymous band, Mudpit, as they try to earn a recording contract through competing in the Japanese massively multiplayer online role-playing game Muzika. Each episode in the series consists of a challenge proposed by Slime, and the band's attempts to win the challenge; during this one of the band members learns an important life lesson. Each episode concludes with an original song sung by the band members. Reese (Vas Saranga) is the founder and leader of Mudpit, and the band's lead guitarist. After being expelled from his brother band Tragic Ballerina, Reese and his childhood friend Geneva enter Muzika in an attempt to win fame. While in Muzika, he is known as Dodge. Geneva (Carleigh Beverly) is Reese's childhood friend, and the band's drummer. She is the writer of most of the band's music, and enters Muzika in order to express herself to a worldwide audience. Being Reese's close friend, she quits Tragic Ballerina as a sign of solidarity. It is hinted that she might have a small crush on Liam. Mikey (Daniel Magder) is Geneva's younger brother, and the band's bass guitarist. He is experienced at video games, and had been playing Muzika as a solo act before Reese and Geneva started to play. He enters Muzika in search of fame, and the prospects of being a ladies' man that comes with it. While in Muzika, he is known as Booch. Liam (Jesse Rath) is the band's lead singer. Though he is a musical school prodigy, he comes from a very strict upbringing and, because of this, is socially awkward and inept at video games. However, he is caring at heart, and is supportive of his three friends. It is hinted that he may have a crush on Geneva. While in Muzika, he is known as Lamb. Kyle (Kjartan Hewitt) is Reese's stepbrother, and was the lead singer in Tragic Ballerina before kicking Reese out of the band after he had a failed attempt at a crowd dive. With the departure of Reese and Geneva, the three remaining members reinvent themselves as the Spoilers. Reese and Kyle often have a combative relationship, with Kyle often attempting to prank or one-up his stepbrother. While in Muzika, he is known by the name Darkrider. Fitzy (Jeff Douglas) is the owner of the \"Game & Grub\", a restaurant and smoothie bar in Toronto where Reese and Geneva is introduced to the world of Muzika. The restaurant also contains a number of game rooms where players may rent out in order to play Muzika. Fitzy had been part of a 90s boy band known as Barry and the Boys, and had apparently saved his money and moved on from the music world to open the Game & Grub. As such, he often acts as a mentor to Mudpit and other bands that may play Muzika there. Slime (Robert Tinkler) is the host of Muzika, who acts as the judge in the various musical challenges that he imposes on Muzika players. As a computer character, he notably only refers to all of the human characters solely by their Muzika names. He is often harsh and condescending towards the various bands, and Mudpit in particular, he does grudgingly respect their accomplishments in the end. The Ava-tarts are an all-female band centered on its lead singer, Sweetie (Meghan Heffern). They had attempted to recruit Geneva away from Mudpit to capitalize on their seemingly chauvinistic behaviour, only for Geneva to go back to Mudpit when they tried to take her identity away by forcing her to change her name to \"S\" and making her play the triangle, so as to not overshadow Sweetie. Crush the Zebra are a punk rock band considered to be completely inept at video games, and is often considered to be \"the worst band in Muzika\". The Prickly Pears are a country band whose band members are shaped like cacti. They eventually win the fans needed to win a road trip challenge, but are defeated in the last moment when Mudpit performs an impromptu concert in the middle of the street to win the challenge.\n",

        "reference": " Zan, a warlord known as the \"White Horse General\", and Yuan Shao, a scion of the esteemed Yuan clan and former leader of the coalition against Dong Zhuo. The two warlords had been fighting for dominion over northern China for some time, but eventually Yuan Shao gained the upper hand. However, Gongsun Zan still had a large army which could cause trouble if not finished off. Gongsun Zan, after recent military defeats in addition to a famine in his lands, decided to secure his supplies. He built a fortress, Yijing (\u6613\u4eac; northwest of present-day Xiong County, Hebei), where he built many large towers on top of mounds where he and his generals lived. There were ten moats around the fortress and the towers had iron doors with huge grain supplies for Gongsun Zan to use to live out the civil wars in northern China. In doing so, Gongsun Zan let his armies away from his fortress fight for themselves thinking they would see the only option they had was to fight hard. Instead, the soldiers killed their commanders and surrendered or died easily while fighting. In time Yuan Shao's army reached the gates of Yijing, but the fortress withstood several attacks from Yuan Shao's army for years until 198. Gongsun Zan sent his son Gongsun Xu to request help from the Heishan bandits in the Taihang Mountains. Gongsun Zan's idea was to break through the siege with his cavalry and group with the Heishan bandits, then attack Ji Province and cut off Yuan Shao's line of retreat, forcing him to abandon the siege. However, Guan Jing advised against the plan, saying that the defenders were only willing to fight to protect their families in Yijing and could not be relied on to defend Yijing if Gongsun Zan left. Gongsun Zan then took Guan Jing's suggestion to withstand the siege until the time when Yuan Shao would be forced to retreat. After Gongsun Xu left, Gongsun Zan had sent a message to his son, instructing him to lay an ambush of 5,000 elite cavalry on low ground north of Yijing. They would then signal to Gongsun Zan to charge out of Yijing with his troops and surround Yuan Shao's troops. However, Yuan Shao's troops caught the messenger and laid their own troops in ambush. Yuan Shao's forces then signalled Gongsun Zan and lured him into the ambush, where they routed his troops and forced him to return to Yijing. Yuan Shao's troops followed up their success by digging tunnels under Yijing and then supporting them with beams, which they later torched. The tunnel went into the centre of Yijing and its collapse caused Gongsun Zan's towers to crumble as well. Realising his doom, Gongsun Zan killed his sisters and wives and committed suicide by self-immolation. Yuan Shao's men climbed into the citadel and cut off Gongsun Zan's head, which was sent to Xuchang to report Yuan Shao's victory to the imperial court. Feeling that his advice had doomed his lord, Guan Jing charged his horse into Yuan Shao's army to his death, with the intention to follow his lord. By the time Gongsun Xu and Zhang Yan returned to Yijing with 100,000 troops, it was too late as Gongsun Zan had already lost the battle and committed suicide.\n",

        "reference": " for Best Novel in 1975. It explores sexual themes, particularly the view that homosexuality is a normal variant of human sexuality. The Heritage of Hastur is set in what Bradley called Darkover's Second Age Against the Terrans (after the Comyn). In The Bloody Sun, Lew Alton is described as age 11, which suggests that this book takes place 10\u201315 years later. The story, told from the alternating points of view of Regis Hastur and Lewis Alton, starts from the storyline of Regis Hastur. While riding from Nevarsin to Thendera, Regis Hastur's party encounters Kennard Alton and his sons, Lewis and Marius. Lew introduces Regis to Danilo Syrtis. They ride to Comyn Castle. When Kennard is injured by a fall, Lew takes over as captain of the guard. He objects to Dyan Ardais being named Cadet Master, because of rumors that Ardais is a pederast and sadist. Kennard overrules his son, saying that the rumors were unfounded. Members of the Comyn Council meet with the Terran Legate regarding rumors that forbidden weapons are being sold in the city of Caer Donn. The Comyn claim that this is a breach of both the Compact (Darkovan tradition concerning weapons) and of the Terran Empire's treaty with the council. The Terrans claim that Aldaran is essentially a separate country, so different laws apply. The matter is unresolved. Kennard suggests instead that Lew make a diplomatic journey to Aldaran. Danilo Syrtis is thrown out of the guard for drawing a sword on Cadet Master Ardais. Lew suspects that Ardais has been making sexual advances towards Danilo, but is unable to prove it. Broken, Danilo departs for the Syrtis estate, where Regis later confronts him. After an argument, Danilo reveals the details of Dyan Ardais\u2019 attempt to rape him, both physically and telepathically. Regis persuades Danilo to bring charges against Ardais. Lew arrives at the city of Caer Donn and Aldaran Castle, where he meets Kermiac, Lord Aldaran, who explain's Lew's Aldaran family connections. Lew is introduced to his cousin, Beltran, and Lord Aldaran's foster children, Marjorie, Thyra and Rafe Scott, and the mysterious Robert Kadarin. He learns they have been experimenting with matrix technologies. Lew is drawn in, without realizing the dangers, and agrees to help train them. Lew later discovers that Kadarin has acquired Sharra, an ancient and dangerously powerful matrix. Kermiac Aldaran dies as a result  of the Sharra Matrix experiments, largely due to a mistake made by the increasingly insane Thyra. Beltran kidnaps Danilo and tries to force him to join, but Danilo refuses. Regis arrives on horseback in search of Danilo, and depart on horseback after Kermiac Aldaran's funeral. Lew heads to Arillinn with Marjorie Scott, but Beltran's guard return them to Aldaran. Kadarin's experiments result in the destruction of Caer Donn, which Lew had foreseen. Lew attempts to control the Sharra matrix, and he, with the help of Arillinn, is saved. Marjorie Scott dies of her injuries. The Terrans agree to honor the Compact throughout Darkover, now understanding its true purpose. Dyan Ardais makes amends to Danilo Syrtis by naming Danilo the heir to the Ardais Domain. Regis pledges his life to the service of Darkover. Lew Alton leaves Darkover, taking the Sharra Matrix with him.\n",

        "prefix": "WWWQ-HD3 (99. 7-3 FM) \u2013 branded OG 97. 9 \u2013 is a digital subchannel of Atlanta market radio station WW",
        "reference": "WQ (99. 7 FM). Owned by Cumulus Media, WWWQ-HD3 functions as a commercial classic hip-hop radio station, serving the Atlanta metropolitan area. Using the proprietary technology HD Radio for its main digital transmission, WWWQ-HD2 also simulcasts over Riverdale-licensed low-power analog translator W250BC (97. 9 FM), and streams online. The WWWQ-HD3 studios are located in the Atlanta suburb of Sandy Springs, while the WWWQ-HD3 and W250BC transmitters both reside in Atlanta's Druid Hills neighborhood. Although licensed as a broadcast translator prohibited from carrying its own programming, it broadcasts under a legal loophole allowed by the Federal Communications Commission, by simulcasting on HD Radio channel 3 of WWWQ FM 99. 7, allowing such stations to sidestep the restriction on translators, as well as regulations regarding the excessive concentration of media ownership by a single company in a given media market. It has a power of 250 watts but at great height, and is transmitted from a major broadcast tower near North Druid Hills along with several other FM and TV stations. It has a broadcast range of approximately, depending on how weather and other factors affect radio propagation conditions of other distant stations that can cause interference. At 250 watts, W250BC has a broadcast range only slightly larger than 99-watt W256BO, however it also does not suffer from the co-channel RF interference that 99. 1 has. Both stations are predicted to cover the core area of metro Atlanta, but the weak signal strength in the exurbs often causes the signal there to be choppy on 97. 9, and even more so on 99. 1 (which is at 50% power temporarily, dropping signal strength by 30%). Both are at  above average terrain at exactly the same coordinates, indicating their transmitters likely share the same radio antenna through a diplexer. Both are also licensed as class D, meaning they must accept interference from all full-power stations. When Cumulus brought 100. 5 in from northeast Alabama in 2001, it was this FCC rule that was used to put WGHR and W264AE off the air. It was originally a 6-watt translator for WCLK FM 91. 9 at Clark Atlanta University, which sold it to another company, which in turn traded it for WZBN FM in south Georgia. It is still licensed to serve Riverdale, although that city has never been within its legally-defined broadcast range. Although identified as \"WWWQ HD3\" (and previously HD2), the FCC still lists W250BC as rebroadcasting parent station WNNX FM (\"Rock 100. 5\" in analog and HD1, previously no HD2). That station forced two other LPFM stations (like W250BC) permanently off-air when it moved to Atlanta as WWWQ in 2001: WGHR at Southern Polytechnic State University, and W264AE from Georgia Public Broadcasting. From September 2010 to February 2011, Cumulus also owned W229AG FM 93. 7, which broadcasts WCNN AM 680 \"The Fan\" (originally KAWZ under Calvary Chapel). This was previously carried on WWWQ's HD3 channel, and also transmits FM from the WWWQ tower at the same height, and likely the same antenna as W250BC. It was sold to WCNN owner Dickey Broadcasting by Cumulus, whose CEO is Lew Dickey. When purchased by Cumulus Broadcasting, the station was changed from a true translator to be the new home for legendary 99X, which had previously been removed from WNNX FM 99. 7 (now WWWQ) to make room for Q100's move from WWWQ FM 100. 5 (now WNNX, \"Rock 100. 5\"). In the meantime, 99X had gone to being on Internet radio only, returning to FM broadcasting in 2009 on April 17 at 9:09 a.m. on W250BC. Despite the mismatch between the old moniker and the new frequency numbers, the station continued to carry 99X for just over two years, and identified on air as \"WWWQ HD2\" but listed as having WNNX (at 100. 5) as its parent station. In spring 2011, Cumulus bought noncommercial W205CI FM 88. 9 (later W258BU on 99. 5) and made an identical move as it had with W250BC. It was changed to 99. 1 (FM channel 256), and the supposed \"translator\" station was moved to the same broadcast tower as its parent station. Its broadcast callsign became W256BO, with the last two serial letters being assigned once its construction permit became a broadcast license. It was under program test authority until then, running at 50% power due to legal requirements to ensure proper engineering and installation of its slightly directional antenna. On June 10, 2011, 99X began simulcasting on both 97. 9 and 99. 1 until June 15. On the 15th, 97. 9 had dead air all night (possibly unintentionally, due to severe thunderstorms in the evening), then began stunting on the morning of the 16th with an hour-long loop of clips of various genres of music, from smooth jazz to dance to country. It also included a segment of tribute to Michael Jackson, snippets of Casey Kasem describing the then-new Compact Disc technology from a 1980s American Top 40, and even old airchecks of bumpers from 99X (from its days on 99. 7 FM) and predecessor Power 99 (WAPW), as well as WQXI. As \"Journey 97. At exactly Noon on the 17th, the station began airing its new format as \"Journey 97-9\", with a three-minute introduction, and a short promo by Randy Jackson, former bass player for 1980s rock band Journey, followed by their song \"Don't Stop Believin'\". The format was promoted as a \"journey\" through 1980s and 1990s popular music, similar to another Journey-branded station Cumulus launched in Cincinnati the month before. Industry website Radio Insight confirmed that Rick Dees would be the network-fed DJ on the station as it is at the Cincinnati station (as well as airing Dees' Weekly Top 40: 90's Edition on Sunday mornings and nights). The station was initially running without radio commercials for a few months (before airing commercials by the Fall of 2011), and despite rumors that local air personalities would appear on the station, the station was primarily run by broadcast automation during its run on the frequency. As Q100 20 @ 97. On September 4, 2012, at 3 p.m., without warning, the station dropped its 80s/90s Hits format and replaced it with a format playing a loop of the then-current Top 20 popular music songs, as well as newer hit music, modeled after SiriusXM's now-defunct 20 on 20 channel. The station was branded as a spinoff of sister station WWWQ (\"Q100\") as \"Q100 20 @ 97. 9\". The format was created to counter-act rival WKLS, which flipped from its long-running Rock format to Top 40 the week before. As OG 97. As a translator, the station did not make much of an impact in the Nielsen radio ratings for the Atlanta market, garnering a meager 0. 6 in the Top 20 format's last month. The station began interspersed Christmas music at the beginning of November 2014, as rumors abounded 97. 9 would flip to the format full-time and reveal its new format after the holidays, but this turned out to be merely a ruse. On November 25, 2014, at Noon, after playing \"What I Like About You\" by 5 Seconds of Summer, W250BC flipped to the ever-expanding classic hip hop format as \"OG 97. 9\", about a week after WTZA (and its FM translator 99. 3 W257DF) flipped to the format. The first song on \"OG\" was Gin & Juice by Snoop Dogg. In addition, the station will also compete against Radio One-owned W275BK, which flipped to the format 5 hours after W250BC's flip.\n",

        "prefix": "Pierre Marie Auguste Broussonet (28 February 1761 \u2013 17 January 1807), French naturalist, was born at Montpellier. His father",
        "reference": ", Fran\u00e7ois Broussonet (1722-1792), was a physician and professor of medicine at famous Universit\u00e9 de Montpellier. His brother, Victor, studied there and later became its dean. Henri Fouquet (1727-1806), a professor at the medical school, was a relative, as was Jean-Antoine Chaptal (1756-1832), who subsequently became minister of the interior. As a child, Pierre showed a passion for natural history, cluttering his father's house with specimen collections. In school, he excelled in classical studies in Montpellier, Mont\u00e9limar, and Toulouse. Because of family tradition, he was headed toward studying medicine, which, at that time, included the study of the natural sciences which had not yet split off to form a separate discipline. Antoine Gouan (1733-1821), a convinced Linnaean, taught at the Montpellier medical school - apparently it was from him that Broussonet learned of Linnaeus\u2019 work. His thesis was entitled M\u00e9moire pour servir \u00e0 l'histoire de la respiration des poissons, which he defended in 1778. He received his doctorate on 27 May 1779, at the age of eighteen. Broussonet\u2019s thesis was unanimously praised. Despite his youth, the professors of the University of Montpellier asked that he be made his father\u2019s successor when the latter retired (a rare but not uncommon request). The request was not granted, in spite of Broussonet himself traveling to Paris to plead his cause. But while in Paris he established friendships scholars who made it possible for him to continue his studies on fish. Although the Paris ichthyological collections surpassed those that Broussonet had worked from in the South, they were not comprehensive enough for the classification work he wished to pursue. Ultimately, he went to England to seek the specimens needed for the morphological and systematic work he had in mind. 1780 London offered Broussonet all he could wish for: an active scientific community; naturalists already embracing Linnaeus\u2019 ideas; collections rich in new species; and an influential friend, Sir Joseph Banks (1743-1820). With his promotion, Broussonet was elected to the Royal Society. Banks had brought back from Cook's first expedition a considerable number of exotic fish, which he turned over to Broussonet for study, thereby making it possible for Broussonet to start his Ichthyologiae Decas I, which was to contain descriptions of 1,200 species. The first ten sections, in which he noted the important discovery of the Pseudobranchia, were published in 1782 (Broussonet's Ichthyologia was never completed). When Broussonet returned to his homeland in 1782, he brought a Chinese maidenhair tree (Ginkgo biloba), given by Sir Joseph Banks and the first specimen of this tree imported into France. This species is often called a living fossil because it was first observed by Europeans in fossil records before they discovered living trees in the Zhejiang province in eastern China. He presented this rare tree to Gouan, then Directeur du Jardin des plantes de Montpellier, who planted it in the garden in 1788, where it can still be found. Broussonet also spent several months botanizing in the South of France and Catalonia with John Sibthorp (1758-1796) with Father Pierre Andr\u00e9 Pourret (1754-1818). When he returned to Paris in 1785, Broussonet presented some of his Notes ichthyologiques before the Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences. Their merit and the support of Louis Jean-Marie D\u2019Aubenton (1716-1799), who, although anti-Linnaean, was friendly toward Broussonet, resulted in his election to the Academy. The challenges met by pre-revolutionary France led to Broussonet's decision to abandon the science of ichthyology. Many thought that the improvement of agricultural production, both in quality and in quantity, was an important priority. This view was especially held by Berthier de Sauvigny (1737-1789), the administrator of Paris, and responsible for its food supply. He had met Broussonet while in England studying methods of cultivation and animal husbandry. Berthier, who had revived the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d\u2019Agriculture, persuaded Broussonet to become its secretary. In addition to this post, Daubenton, who in 1783 had accepted the chair of rural economy at the Alfort Veterinary School, passed on this additional responsibility to his young friend. Broussonet tried hard to fulfill the duties of his new offices. From 1785-1788, he published short notices, some signed, some anonymous (many are still unidentified to this day), for the use of farmers. Unfortunately, this work came too late, and the beginning of the French Revolution put an end to Broussonet's agricultural efforts. Broussonet, then twenty-eight in 1789, enthusiastically welcomed revolutionary ideas, as was characteristic of his generation, but he was horrified by the tactics of the extreme left. On 22 July 1789, his friend Berthier, held responsible for the current famine, was lynched and dragged through the streets before his eyes. Seeing the danger, Broussonet fled Paris. In 1792 he took refuge in Montpellier but was accused of federalism and thrown in jail. He remained there only a few days, but his liberty was still precarious after his release. He then left Montpellier for Bagn\u00e8res-de-Bigorre to join his brother Victor, then a doctor in the army of Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Orientales. On 19 July 1794 he crossed the Spanish border. Broussonet was warmly received by the botanists Casimiro G\u00f3mez Ortega (1741-1818) and Antonio Jos\u00e9 Cavanilles (1745-1804) in Madrid, Gordon in Jerez, and Jos\u00e9 Francisco Correia da Serra (1750\u20131823) in Lisbon. Banks also continued to be in contact and helped him financially. But French citizens who had emigrated to Spain earlier looked upon him as a revolutionary. Having become friends with Simpson, American consul in Gibraltar, Broussonet accompanied him as physician on a diplomatic mission to Morocco, where he studied the flora. In 1795, when he returned to France, Broussonet's name was removed from the list of political refugees, and he regained possession of his property. Elected to the Institut in 1796, he requested appointment as a voyageur de l\u2019Institut, stating that he wished to return to Morocco to continue his research. In 1797 he was named vice-consul at Mogador. There he carried on his work of collecting and describing plants and animals, as well as attending to his consular duties. In 1798, Ortega attempted to honor Brousonet with genus Broussonetia in the family Fabaceae, but it was rejected (now Sophora). In 1799, Charles Louis L'H\u00e9ritier de Brutelle (1746\u20131800) successfully honored Brousonet with the genus Broussonetia (family Moraceae, tribe Moreae). A plague threatened Mogador in 1799. On 8 July, Broussonet sailed with his family to the Canary Islands, where he became commissioner of commercial relations. He continued his collecting and observations, writing of them to Cavanilles, L'H\u00e9ritier, and Humboldt. When the local authorities forbade him to travel, Broussonet decided to leave his post. He asked to be sent to the Cape of Good Hope, where he hoped to create a botanical garden. Chaptal, then minister of the interior, supported his young relative's request, and Broussonet was named commissioner of commercial relations to the Cape on 15 October 1802. He returned to France in 1803 to prepare for this new assignment, only to learn that Chaptal had changed his mind and had had him made professor at the medical school of Montpellier, to succeed Gouan. Besides its teaching duties, Broussonet's new title, Directeur du Jardin des Plantes de Montpellier, put him in charge of the botanical gardens. He restored its former layout and, helped financially by Chaptal, built an orangery, dug ponds, and enlarged the collections, of which he published a list in 1805 - Elenchus plantarum horti botanici Monspeliensis. Broussonet was preparing to describe the 1,500 species collected at Tenerife when he suffered a stroke that caused a gradually worsening aphasia. On 17 August 1806 he notified the director of the medical school that he must resign his post, and a year later, he suffered a final stroke that caused his death.

Dahinden was a major advocate for the controversial Patterson\u2013Gimlin film, which was taken in 1967 and supposedly provides photographic evidence of Bigfoot. He also co-wrote a book, Sasquatch, with Don Hunter, which was published in 1973 in a hardcover edition. In 1975, the book would be issued as a paperback. This title would then be revised and renamed in 1993 as Sasquatch/Bigfoot: The Search for North America's Incredible Creature, Revised Edition. David Suchet's French Canadian Bigfoot-hunting character in the 1987 film Harry and the Hendersons is based on Dahinden.

The performance was filmed and recorded for the By a Thread \u2013 Live in London 2011 CD/DVD box set, along with performances of the other 3 Devin Townsend Project albums (up to that point). The song \"Drench\", a leftover slated to appear on a second volume of Ghost, was shared by Townsend on his official SoundCloud account. Later, Mackie Gear posted the leftover track \"Fall\" on SoundCloud. The album was well received by Metal Hammer, who said, \"Ghost could be the most convincing album of his career\".

The airfield was constructed around 1960 and was initially classified by the CIA as a long range bomber base, though it was never completed. US KH-4 reconnaissance satellite passes in 1963 showed no aircraft activity at the base but indicated an exceptionally long 15,000\u00a0ft (4600 m) runway. However this runway was made of graded earth and analysts determined the airfield was probably not usable during the summertime due to mud and drainage across the surfaces. The airfield was likely intended as a winter season arctic staging base, as the open tundra and packed snow would allow for large numbers of bomber aircraft to be serviced with minimal infrastructure. The base would then be abandoned each spring. The airfield was intended for staging and dispersal for the Soviet Union's Tupolev Tu-95 and Tupolev Tu-22 bomber force. The position of Aspidnoye on the shore of the Arctic Ocean would have given it access to northern resupply ship routes for fuel supplies. A defense radar facility, probably a P-14 Tall King unit, exists on satellite imagery 14\u00a0km northwest of the airfield. The last reference in declassified CIA documents to Aspidnoye was in 1973 when it appeared in a target list. It was listed as non-operational and covered by snow.\n",

        "prefix": "The New York City Marathon (currently branded TCS New York City Marathon for sponsorship reasons) is an annual marathon () that courses through the five boroughs of New",
        "reference": " York City. It is the largest marathon in the world, with 52,812 finishers in 2018 and 98,247 applicants for the 2017 race. Along with the Boston Marathon, it is among the pre-eminent long-distance annual running events in the United States and is one of the World Marathon Majors. The race is organized by New York Road Runners and has been run every year since 1970, with the exception of 2012, when it was cancelled due to the landfall of Hurricane Sandy. The race is held on the first Sunday of November and attracts professional competitors and amateurs from all over the world. Because of the popularity of the race, participation is chosen largely by a lottery system. Guaranteed entry to the marathon can be gained by satisfying the requirements of the 9+1 program or the 9+$1K program (where NYRR members run in nine sponsored races and either volunteer at another event or donate $1,000 to support NYRR programs for young athletes), having completed 15 or more previous NYC Marathons, or meeting time qualification standards. In addition, runners can gain an entry by joining a team to raise funds for one of a number of charities. The race was founded by Fred Lebow. Ted Corbitt helped plan the course of the New York City Marathon. The initial course of 1970 consisted of repeated racing around Central Park. From 1976, the course covers all five boroughs of New York City. It begins on Staten Island, in Fort Wadsworth, near the approach to the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge. The bridge, which normally carries only vehicular traffic, is closed for the event. Runners use both sides of the upper level of the bridge and the westbound side of the lower level. In the opening minutes of the race, the bridge is filled with runners, creating a dramatic spectacle that is closely associated with the event. After descending the bridge, the course winds through Brooklyn, mostly along Fourth Avenue and Bedford Avenue, for approximately the next. Runners pass through a variety of neighborhoods, including: Bay Ridge, Sunset Park, Park Slope, Bedford-Stuyvesant, Williamsburg, and Greenpoint. At, runners cross the Pulaski Bridge, marking the halfway point of the race and the entrance into Long Island City, Queens. After about  in Queens, runners cross the East River via the Queensboro (59th Street) Bridge into Manhattan. It is at this point in the race when many runners begin to tire, as the climb up the bridge is considered one of the most difficult points in the marathon. Reaching Manhattan after about, the race proceeds north on First Avenue, then crosses into The Bronx via the Willis Avenue Bridge. The race is only in The Bronx for one mile before returning to Manhattan as the course follows East 138th St. before crossing the Madison Avenue Bridge. It then proceeds south through Harlem down Fifth Avenue and into Central Park at East 90th St. At the southern end of the park, the race proceeds west along 59th Street/Central Park South, where thousands of spectators cheer runners on during the last mile. At Columbus Circle, the race reenters the park and finishes beside Tavern on the Green. The time limit for this course is 8\u00bd hours from the 10:10\u00a0a.m. start. In 2008, the race initiated a corral system. Professional women runners were given a separate, earlier start and the balance of the runners began in three staggered starts. The official times are those recorded by a computer chip attached to the back of the runner's bib number, which calculates when a runner crosses the start and when she crosses the finish, known as \"net time\" (as opposed to \"gun time\"). Runners also pass timing mats at 5\u00a0km intervals along the course, and e-mail notifications can be received by people following runners during the race to track their progress. Whereas the distance is the same, there are different courses taken through Bay Ridge and up Fourth Avenue in Brooklyn until the course reaches Lafayette Avenue in Brooklyn at Mile 8. Although the marathon publicity material uses miles, the timing mats are at 5\u00a0km intervals to accommodate the publishing of splits and also enabling potential world records for 20\u00a0km, 30\u00a0km and other sub-marathon distances to be recorded. The first New York City Marathon was held  on September 13, 1970, organized by New York Road Runners presidents; Fred Lebow and Vincent Chiappetta, with 127 competitors running several loops around the Park Drive of Central Park. Only about 100 spectators watched Gary Muhrcke win the race in 2:31:38. In fact, a total of only 55 runners crossed the finish line. Over the years, the marathon grew larger and larger. To celebrate the U.S. bicentennial in 1976, city auditor George Spitz proposed that the race traverse all five boroughs. With the support of Manhattan Borough President Percy Sutton, the men convinced Mayor Beame and, eventually, race director Fred Lebow. The race was a huge success, and what was intended as a one-time celebration, became the annual course. Dick Traum became the first person to complete a marathon with a prosthetic leg when he finished the 1976 New York City Marathon. The marathon grew in popularity two years later when Norwegian Grete Waitz broke the women's world record, finishing in 2:32:30. She went on to win the race an unprecedented nine times. An official wheelchair and handcycle division was introduced in 2000, and starting in 2002, the elite women are given a 35-minute head start before the elite men and rest of the field. Beginning in 1976, the race was run in late October and continued to be held in late October until 1986, when the race day was moved to November. The earliest race day was the marathon's first; the latest date in the season of the marathon was November 14, 1993. The hottest year for the race was 1979, when the race day of October 21 reached 80\u00b0F (27\u00b0C). The coldest race was in 1995, when the race day of November 12 only reached 43\u00b0F (6\u00b0C), with a strong wind chill. The New York City Marathon has now become the largest marathon anywhere in the world. Each year nearly two million spectators line the course. Prior to 2013, the marathon was broadcast live in the New York area on WNBC, and on Universal Sports for the entire country, However, in 2013, WABC-TV and ESPN announced they would begin broadcasting the New York City Marathon. The Marathon can also be watched online. On September 13, 1970, Gary Muhrcke wins the first New York City Marathon held in Central Park in 2:31:38. 127 runners started the race and 55 finished. Nina Kuscsik, the sole woman entrant in the race, dropped out at 15 miles due to illness. On September 29, 1974, Norbert Sander and Kathrine Switzer became the only New York City residents to win the New York City Marathon, Sander winning in 2:26:30 and Switzer the women's division in 3:07:29. Future four-time NYC Marathon champion Bill Rodgers placed fifth in 2:36:00 out of 259 finishers (250 men, 9 women). After being run in Central Park from 1970-1975, this edition of the marathon traverses all five boroughs for the first time. There was 2,090 entrants and 1,549 finishers. Bill Rodgers, who finished 40th in the 1976 Olympic Games marathon in 2:25:14, comes back to win the NYC Marathon in a course record 2:10:10. He beat 1976 Olympic marathon silver medalist Frank Shorter who finished second by more than three minutes, Shorter clocking 2:13:12. Forty-one year old Miki Gorman is the first woman in 2:39:11, also a course record. Bill Rodgers and Miki Gorman repeat as the top male and female finishers from the year before, Rodgers winning in 2:11:28 and Gorman in 2:43:10. Bill Rodgers wins his third consecutive New York City Marathon in 2:12:12 on a warm day. Grete Waitz, the Norwegian long distance runner, sets a new course record for women at 2:32:30 and wins her first New York Marathon. Waitz goes on to win 9 New York Marathons, the most course wins in any category to date. She is widely acknowledged for having made a significant contribution to promote marathon and long-distance running for women. The New York Road Runners club annually sponsors \"Grete's Great Gallop,\" a 10 kilometer race around the Central Park loop, in her honor. For the first time in NYC Marathon history, over 10,000 runners (10,477) complete the race. Bill Rodgers wins his fourth and last New York City Marathon on another warm day in 2:11:42, the temperature topping out at 80 degrees, overtaking Kirk Pfeffer who led for the first 23 1/2 miles of the race. Grete Waitz again won the women's race with a finish time of 2:27:33, becoming the first woman ever to break 2:30. In a normally trivial mistake, Rosie Ruiz was accidentally given a finish time of 2:56:29. This qualified her for the 1980 Boston Marathon, where she crossed the finish line with a record time of 2:31:56. It was quickly determined that she had not run the entire course in either race, igniting the best-known scandal in the history of modern distance running. New York Marathon chief Fred Lebow rescinded Ruiz's time after determining she had not finished the 1979 race, and officials in Boston quickly followed suit. Alberto Salazar, a NCAA cross-country champion, wins the 1980 New York City Marathon in 2:09:41. At the time this was the fastest marathon debut by an American. His performance was also a course record. He would defend his title in 1981 and 1982. Grete Waitz won her third straight NYC Marathon in 2:25:42, also setting the course record in the womens division. Alberto Salazar's 2:08:13 was initially considered to be a world's best in the marathon, but the mark was later rescinded by The Athletics Congress, now known as USA Track & Field, when the course was measured to be short by approximately. Salazar remarked in 1985 that he would continue to believe that he ran a full marathon, since the lack of crowd control forced him to run wide during his turns. He has also suggested that a change in how courses were measured after the 1981 race attributed to the discrepancy in the course length. The national television audience was treated to a thrilling race as England's Geoff Smith held a lead through the last half of the race. He was caught at the 26 mile mark in Central Park by 1972 Olympic 1500 metres bronze medalist Rod Dixon from New Zealand, who won by just 9 seconds. Dixon had been as far as 2 and a half minutes behind with 10\u00a0km to go, but steadily loomed over Smith's shoulder. The result was also one of the great \"Thrill of Victory/Agony of Defeat\" photos of all time as Dixon stood at the finish line celebrating with a collapsed and defeated Smith on the ground behind him. Orlando Pizzolato struggled to victory in this year's marathon on a hot day, stopping six times due to heat cramps, but still winning by over a minute in 2:14:53. This is the slowest winning time since 1976 when the New York City Marathon became a world class event. Grete Waitz won her sixth NYC Marathon in 2:29:30. Orlando Pizzolato and Grete Waitz repeated as the men's and women's winners. Pizzolato won in easier fashion than in 1984, winning in 2:11:34. Waitz won her seventh NYC Marathon in 2:28:06. This year's marathon was held in November (November 2) for the first time and has been ever since. Gianni Poli of Italy won in 2:11:06, the third year in a row the men's winner was from Italy. Grete Waitz won for the eighth time in 2:28:06. Ibrahim Hussein of Kenya won the NYC Marathon in 2:11:01, the first man from Africa to do so. Priscilla Welch of Great Britain won in 2:30:17, as Grete Waitz did not compete this year. Steve Jones of the United Kingdom wins this years event in 2:08:20, the first man from this nation to do so. Grete Waitz wins her ninth and last NYC Marathon in 2:28:07. On a warm November day (November 4th) that hit 73 degrees, Douglas Wakiihuri of Kenya wins this year's event in 2:12:39. Since 1976 when the marathon became a world class event, his winning performance is the second slowest to date (Orlando Pizzolato ran 2:14:53 on a hot day in the 1984 NYC Marathon). Wanda Panfil of Poland is the top woman in 2:30:45. She is the only woman to date from Poland to win this event. Grete Waitz, attempting to win her 10th NYC Marathon, finishes fourth in 2:34:34 and then retires from competitive distance running at age 37. Grete Waitz completed her last New York Marathon with her friend and race co-founder, Fred Lebow, in celebration of Lebow's 60th birthday. Lebow had been diagnosed with brain cancer and died two years later in 1994. They both completed the race with a time of 5:32:35. Waitz would herself succumb to cancer in 2011 after what she called the toughest fight of her life. The men's winner of this year's marathon was Willie Mtolo of South Africa in 2:09:29. Lisa Ondieki of Australia was the women's winner in 2:24:40, a course record that would last for nine years. During the 1994 event, Germ\u00e1n Silva recovered from a wrong turn seven-tenths of a mile before the finish that put him temporarily in second place 40 yards behind Benjam\u00edn Paredes. He ran a 5:15 final mile, including the detour, to beat Paredes and win the event by two seconds with a time of 2:11:21. To date, this event was the coldest NYC Marathon ever (1979 was the warmest, topping out at 80 degrees). The temperature at race time was 40 degrees and only went up a few degrees as the race progressed. Wind gusts between 30-45 mph produced a wind chill factor in the upper 20s. Both male and female winners repeated their 1994 victories. Germ\u00e1n Silva of Mexico was victorious in 2:11:00. Tegla Loroupe of Kenya followed suit, also repeating as women's champion in 2:28:06. Loroupe the year prior was the first woman from Africa to win the NYC Marathon. The total number of finishers exceeds 30,000 (30,427) for the first time. John Kagwe of Kenya wins the mens division in 2:08:12 and will defend his title the following year. Franziska Rochat-Moser from Switzerland is the first woman in 2:28:43. The 2000 NYC Marathon includes the wheelchair division for men and women for the first time. Prize money is added in 2001. Abdelkader El Mouaziz of Morocco won the men's race in 2:10:09, the first man from that nation to win this event. Lyudmila Petrova of Russia was the first woman in 2:25:45, the first woman from Russia to win this event. The 2001 NYC Marathon took place on November 4th, less than two months after the September 11 attacks symbolizing hope and recovery for a city and nation devastated by this tragic event. Tesfaye Jifar of Ethiopia set a then course record of 2:07:43, a mark that would stand until Geoffrey Mutai broke that record in 2011. On the womens side, Margaret Okayo of Kenya won, setting a then course record of 2:24:21. She would set the course record two years later that still stands through 2019. A record 34,729 people participated in the race. The top male finisher was Martin Lel of Kenya in a time of 2:10:30. The top female finisher was Margaret Okayo of Kenya in time of 2:22:31, breaking her previous course record of 2:24:21 set in 2001. In recent years, runners from Kenya have dominated the event. The top Americans were Matt Downin (2:18:48) and Sylvia Mosqueda (2:33:10), both from California. Rapper P.Diddy also ran for charity and raised $2,000,000 for the New York City Education system. The top female finisher was Britain's Paula Radcliffe in a time of 2:23:10, beating Kenya's Susan Chepkemei by 4 seconds, the closest finish up to that time. The top male was Hendrik Ramaala of South Africa with a time of 2:09:28. The top Americans were Meb Keflezighi (2nd, 2:09:53) from California and Jenny Crain (15th, 2:41:06), from Wisconsin. In the closest finish in New York City Marathon history, Paul Tergat of Kenya barely outsprinted Hendrick Ramaala of South Africa in the final meters of the race for a time of 2:09:30, beating Ramaala by one second. In the women's race, Je\u013cena Prokop\u010duka of Latvia won in a time of 2:24:41. Tops amongst the Americans were Meb Keflezighi of California (2:09:56) and Jen Rhines of California (2:37:07). South African Ernst Van Dyk took the wheelchair race in 1:31:11. The 2005 event was administered by new NYRR CEO Mary Wittenberg. It is notable that she was the first woman director of an international Major marathon. The top male finisher was Mar\u00edlson Gomes dos Santos of Brazil in a time of 2:09:58, while Je\u013cena Prokop\u010duka of Latvia won the female marathon for the second consecutive time in a time of 2:25:05. Gomes dos Santos becomes the first South American ever to win the race. Stephen Kiogora of Kenya placed second, and Paul Tergat, the 2005 defending champion and former marathon world record holder, placed third. Former American professional road racing cyclist and triathlete Lance Armstrong ran in the 2006 race, finishing 868th with a time of 2:59:36. He also ran the same year in the British 10K. Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee also completed the race in 2006, finishing in 5:33:43, and wearing bib #110, signifying the 110 pounds lost during his weight loss campaign. Amanda McGrory won the female wheelchair race in the time of 1:54:17, the male wheelchair division was won by Kurt Fearnley in a time of 1:29:22. The 2007 New York City Marathon was held on Sunday, November 4. It was the final race of the 2006\u20132007 World Marathon Majors, a two-year series of elite marathon racing that also includes the Boston, Chicago, London and Berlin marathons. However, there were very few elite American marathoners participating in 2007 because they competed the day before at the 2008 USA Men's Olympic Marathon Trials, which was held in conjunction with the New York City Marathon on some of the same course, three loops of which Trials were in Central Park. Martin Lel from Kenya won the men's race in a time of 2:09:04, completing an impressive double of the 2007 London and New York Marathons. The women's winner was the world Marathon record holder Paula Radcliffe from Great Britain in a time of 2:23:09, one second faster than her 2004 win. The 2008 New York City Marathon was held on Sunday, November 2. A field of 37,899 runners participated. The men's winner was Mar\u00edlson Gomes dos Santos in 2:08:43. Paula Radcliffe won her third NYC marathon in 2:23:56. Carlos Jose Gomes, 58, of Brazil fell unconscious shortly after completing the race in 4:12:15. An autopsy revealed that he had a pre-existing heart condition and died of a heart attack. Joseph Marotta, 66, of Staten Island, N.Y. succumbed to a heart attack hours after he completed his fourth New York City Marathon. He walked the course in 9:16:46. Fred Costa, 41, from Cincinnati, OH collapsed at the marathon and died on November 15 of a heart attack. The 2009 New York City Marathon was held Sunday November 1, 2009. Meb Keflezighi of the United States won the men's race (the first American since Alberto Salazar in 1982) with a time of 2:09:15 while Ethiopian Derartu Tulu took the women's crown in 2:28:52, the first Ethiopian woman to do so. This was the first marathon in history with more than 40,000 official finishers, as 43,660 crossed the finish, 5,053 more than the previous best at the 2008 edition of this race. The 2010 New York City Marathon was held on November 7. Gebregziabher Gebremariam of Ethiopia, in his first-ever marathon, won the race after breaking away from his last rival, Emmanuel Mutai of Kenya, in the 25th mile to finish in a time of 2:08:14. The race featured 37-year-old world record holder Haile Gebrselassie, who ran with a bad knee and dropped out of the race at the 16th mile. Afterwards, he announced his retirement, but later reversed this decision. Edna Kiplagat won the women's title with a time of 2 hours, 28 minutes, 20 seconds, ahead of American Shalane Flanagan. The total number of official finishers, 44,829 (28,757 men and 16,072 women) was a new world record for a marathon race. The 2011 Marathon was held on November 6. The men's event was won by Geoffrey Mutai of Kenya in a time of 2:05:05, breaking the 10-year-old course record. Second-place runner Emmanuel Mutai, also of Kenya, and third-place runner Tsegaye Kebede of Ethiopia also beat the previous record for the event, with times of 2:06:28 and 2:07:14, respectively. Geoffrey Mutai, who won the Boston Marathon earlier in the year, became the first man to win both races in course-record time in the same year. Firehiwot Dado of Ethiopia won the women's race in a time of 2:23:15, her first major marathon victory. Coming second, 4 seconds behind the leader originally from Ethiopia, but now living in the Bronx, was Bizunesh Deba with a time of 2:23:19. There were a world record 46,795 official finishers: 29,867 men and 16,928 women. Edison Pe\u00f1a, famous for maintaining his running routine during the 69 days he was trapped in the 2010 Copiap\u00f3 mining accident, ran the race. Former NHL player, Mark Messier, finished with a time of 4:14:21 at age 50. Retired Dutch soccer player, Edwin van der Sar, ran in 4:19 and said it was the toughest thing he had ever done. Former CART champion Alex Zanardi won the handcycle class. The 2012 marathon was scheduled for November 4, 2012. Organizers planned to hold the event despite the Effects of Hurricane Sandy in New York the week before. On November 2, 2012, the marathon was cancelled; Mayor Michael Bloomberg explained that: \"While holding the race would not require diverting resources from the recovery effort, it is clear that it has become the source of controversy and division. We would not want a cloud to hang over the race or its participants, and so we have decided to cancel it\". Three days earlier, Bloomberg said the marathon would take place. That declaration started a debate on whether to hold the race with thousands of residents still without electricity, public transportation, and other basic needs. Proponents for going ahead said that the event would give an economic and morale boost to the city, while opponents said the resources (such as food, water, and police) were better used elsewhere. Some of the entrants ended up helping with cleanup efforts. Others chose to congregate and run an informal \"Shadow Marathon\" in Central Park. Controversy over the cancellation of the Marathon, the timing of the announcement and the repercussions of the decision, including criticism of New York Road Runners CEO Mary Wittenberg, continued well after the 2012 race was meant to have taken place. As a resolution, all who were registered to run the 2012 race were offered three options: a refund; guaranteed, non-complimentary entry to the New York City Marathon in 2013, 2014, or 2015; or guaranteed, non-complimentary entry to the NYC Half 2013. The 2013 New York City Marathon was run November 3, 2013. The race proved to be the clincher for the 2013 World Marathon Majors titles for both men and women. Duplicating their London Marathon wins from April 2013, Tsegaye Kebede and Priscah Jeptoo each won $500,000 for their season-wide efforts. After the 2012 cancellation, Geoffrey Mutai returned to become the first repeat winner in 15 years (after John Kagwe in 1997-1998). Under windy conditions, his 2:08:24 was more than 3 minutes slower than in 2011. Mutai broke away around mile 22 to win by almost a minute over Ethiopian Tsegaye Kebede, who had finished third two years earlier. Jeptoo spotted Buzunesh Deba, an Ethiopian runner who has lived in the Bronx since 2009, three and a half minutes at the half-marathon mark, but came back to pass her in the 24th mile. The 2014 New York City Marathon was run on Sunday, November 2, 2014. It was announced on October 2, 2013, that the marathon's main sponsor would be Tata Consultancy Services starting in 2014. It is an eight-year deal, and the race was renamed the TCS New York City Marathon. Wind was unusually high, blowing from the north on a mostly northbound course. Winners were Wilson Kipsang in 2:10:59 and Mary Keitany in 2:25:07. The 2015 New York City Marathon was run on Sunday, November 1, 2015. Winners were Stanley Biwott in 2:10:34 and Mary Keitany in 2:24:25. The 2016 New York City Marathon was run on Sunday, November 6. Ghirmay Ghebreslassie won the men's competition with a time of 2:07:51. The female race winner was Mary Keitany from Kenya in 2:24:26. Male wheelchair race winner was Marcel Hug with a time of 1:35:49, and Female wheelchair race winner was Tatyana McFadden with a time of 1:47:43. In 2016, Lauren Lubin ran as the first openly genderqueer/non-binary athlete in the New York City Marathon. The 2017 TCS New York City Marathon was run on Sunday, November 5. Geoffrey Kamworor, a native of Kenya, won the men's competition with a time of 2:10:53, 3 seconds ahead of 2nd-place finisher Wilson Kipsang. In 3rd place was Lelisa Desisa with a time of 2:11:32. On the women's side, the winner was Shalane Flanagan, a native of Marblehead, Massachusetts. She was the first American to win since 1977. Her time was 2:26:53. Mary Keitany placed 2nd with 2:27:54, and Mamitu Daska finished 3rd with a time of 2:28:08. The 2018 TCS New York City Marathon was run on Sunday, November 4. Lelisa Desisa of Ethiopia won his first New York City Marathon after finishing third in 2017, third in 2015 and second in 2014, followed by Shura Kitata and defending champion Geoffrey Kamworor. Their times of 2:05:59, 2:06:01 and 2:06:26 were the second, third and fourth fastest times in race history. Mary Keitany was in a pack of women that passed halfway in 1:15:50 but then she ran the second 13. 1 miles in 1:06:58, the fastest time ever for any second half of a marathon, to capture her fourth NYC crown in 2:22:48, the second fastest time ever there. London winner, Vivian Cheruiyot was second in 2:26:02 and American Shalane Flanagan placed third in 2:26:22, 31 seconds faster than her winning time the previous year. Once again there were a world record number of finishers, with 52,812 (30,669 men/22,143 women) runners completing the race. The 49th TCS New York City Marathon took place November 3. Joyciline Jepkosgei, of Kenya, won the women's marathon and Geoffrey Kamworor, also of Kenya, won the men's marathon. In total\u2014men and women's competition\u2014four Kenyan and two Ethiopian athletes finished on the podium. Jepkosgei is a first time winner and Kamworor previously won the marathon in 2017. Last year he finished third and in his first NYC marathon, in 2015, he finished second. Manuela Sch\u00e4r, of Switzerland, won the women's push-rim competition and Daniel Romanchuk, of the United States, won the men's push-rim competition. The 2019 NYC Marathon set another world record for the number of finishers ever for a marathon with 53,627 runners crossing the finish line.\n",

        "reference": "usually between 5 and 10) together in a single unit for easier and faster loading of a firearm magazine. It is called a'stripper' clip because, after the bolt is opened and the stripper clip is placed in position (generally by placing it in a slot on either the receiver or bolt), the user presses on the cartridges from above, sliding them down and off the clip, thereby \"stripping\" them off the clip and into the magazine. Stripper clips differ from en bloc clips in that they are not designed to be inserted into the weapon itself, but only to load it or its magazine. Stripper clips were originally employed in infantry bolt action rifles, such as the Russian Mosin\u2013Nagant, the British Lee\u2013Enfield, and the German Gewehr 98 and its variant the Mauser K98k, the related US M1903 Springfield and many others. Stripper clips were also employed in newer, semi-automatic rifles with internal box magazines, such as the Soviet SKS and Egyptian Hakim Rifle. Currently they are used to top-off detachable box magazines for semi-automatic and automatic rifles. A magazine loader is placed on the lip of the box magazine, the clip is placed inside the loader, and then the rounds are pushed into the magazine. It is called a \"stripper\" clip because, after the bolt is opened and the stripper clip is placed in position (generally by placing it in a slot on either the receiver or bolt), the user presses on the cartridges from above, sliding them down and off the clip, thereby stripping them off the clip and into the magazine. After the magazine is loaded, the stripper clip is removed and set aside for reloading, or simply discarded during combat. Generally, a weapon that can use a stripper clip for loading can also be loaded one round at a time, while a weapon designed for an en bloc clip cannot be used without the clip. Depending on the firearm, magazine, and cartridge, stripper clips come in a variety of shapes, some quite complex, though most are either straight or crescent-shaped pieces of stamped metal\u2014usually brass, steel (often blued or parkerized), or plastic. Stripper/charger clips have been used since 1889 (in the form of the Mauser Model 1889, while en bloc clips have been used since roughly the mid-late 1880s. En bloc clips, as used in the M1 Garand as well as the Italian Carcano are designed to be inserted into the magazine itself, essentially a part of the magazine, while stripper clips are intended to load ammo into the magazine while the magazine is intended to load ammo into the chamber. The M1891 Three Line Rifle (aka the first \"Mosin-Nagant\") utilized stripper clips, however the design was improved upon later, namely by Mauser. Mauser clips are inherently smoother and eject automatically upon closing the bolt, while Mosin-Nagant clips require a special technique to get anywhere near the same efficiency but must be manually removed before you can close the bolt, making it inherently slower. Still, it is faster than reloading with single cartridges. Moreover, once some but not all rounds have been fired Mauser clip format guns are as a rule difficult or impossible to top-up to their maximum capacity again with additional cartridges, which is generally easy with stripper-clip loading weapons. Stripper clips were originally employed in infantry bolt action rifles, such as the Russian Mosin\u2013Nagant, the British Lee\u2013Enfield, and the German Gewehr 98 and its variant the Mauser K98k, the related US M1903 Springfield and many others. Stripper clips were also employed in newer, semi-automatic rifles with internal box magazines, such as the Soviet SKS and Egyptian Hakim Rifle. Many early semi-automatic pistols also used stripper clips to reload, including the Mannlicher M1894, the Roth\u2013Steyr M1907, and the Mauser C96.

        "reference": " and unique. It is the first automobile to be offered in hybrid, plug-in hybrid, and all-electric variants. The Ioniq Hybrid debuted in South Korea in January 2016, with all three variants debuting at 2016 Geneva and New York auto shows. The hybrid variant launched in its home market in February 2016, followed by the electric model in July 2016. The plug-in hybrid version followed in February 2017. From its first model year (2017) through the 2019 model year, the Ioniq Electric had been the EPA's most efficient vehicle with a rated fuel economy of 136 miles per gallon gasoline equivalent (mpg-e) (). The Ioniq Blue hybrid version has been rated at 58 miles per gallon, making it the most fuel efficient hybrid vehicle that is mass produced. The Ioniq is Hyundai's first automobile built from the ground up and specifically available as a hybrid or electric powered. The hybrid version competes with, and surpasses in fuel economy, the previous mileage leader in the Toyota Prius. Sharing the same powertrain with the Kia Niro hybrid crossover, the Ioniq is powered by a 1. 6 litre Kappa four cylinder Atkinson-cycle engine with 40% thermal efficiency capable of delivering  and an estimated  of torque alone. The Ioniq Hybrid's electric motor additionally delivers an estimated  with an estimated maximum torque of, powered by a lithium-ion polymer battery with 1. 56 kWh capacity. The battery is positioned under the rear passenger seats. In combination with the 1. 6 litre direct injection engine, the Ioniq Hybrid offers an estimated total system output of  and. This engine is combined with a shifting six speed dual-clutch transmission. Like many hybrids and electric cars, neither the Ioniq Hybrid nor Electric are suitable for towing a trailer. The Ioniq uses aluminium in the hood and tailgate, reducing weight by  compared with conventional steel with no measurable disadvantages in noise or vibration. With a higher usage of lightweight components and a more compact build, the cargo screen cover is about 25% lighter than the types used in other Hyundai models. Its aerodynamic design helped lower the drag coefficient of the Ioniq down to 0. 24. Excessive weight is reduced by utilization of high strength steel for the structure and aluminium for non structural components. Hyundai expects the model with 15 inch wheels to obtain an EPA rated combined fuel economy between  and, just ahead of the 2016 Toyota Prius Eco (). The Ioniq is also available with a 17\" alloy rim option and trims that include the alloy rims produce approximately 5 MPG less overall fuel economy on the highway. The Ioniq Hybrid was released in South Korea in February 2016. The hybrid was launched in Malaysia in November 2016. Two Ioniq Hybrid trims are available, HEV and HEV Plus. Many parked Ioniqs appeared in the early scenes in Johnny English Strikes Again, starring Johnny English, played by Rowan Atkinson. The Hyundai Ioniq Electric is a mid-2010s limited-production all-electric version of the Ioniq that is sold only in select  countries and US states. It features a 28 kWh lithium-ion polymer battery (LiPo) that delivers an EPA-rated all-electric range of . Hyundai originally expected the Ioniq to deliver a range of. At the 2016 LA Auto Show, Hyundai announced that they are planning to extend the electric range of the Ioniq EV to more than  by 2018. However, the increase in battery size did not happen until 2019 and has an 193 mile range WLTP rated. The Ioniq Electric has an 88\u00a0kW (120 PS) electric motor with 295 Nm of torque, and can be charged up to 80% in 33 minutes at 50\u00a0kW or in 24 minutes at 100\u00a0kW with a DC fast charging station. An integrated In-Cable Control Box (ICCB) also allows drivers to charge their Ioniq at a regular household outlet, but this is recommended only for use in emergencies in countries with 110 volt standard outlets. In most countries, with 220-240 volt standard household outlets, 100% range can be added with an overnight charge. The charging plug of the car is located in a position where gas fillers are normally located. The Ioniq features paddle shifters to allow drivers to choose from one of four levels of regenerative braking. As of 2019, Hyundai USA sells the Ioniq Electric only in select states. It is sold by Hyundai in other countries as well, which  included Canada, Norway, Netherlands, Portugal or Switzerland., the car remains listed on the Hyundai website. Under the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) four cycle test, the 2017 Ioniq Electric combined fuel economy rating is 136 miles per gallon gasoline equivalent (mpg-e) (), with an energy consumption of 25\u00a0kW\u00b7h/100\u00a0mi (). The fuel economy rating for city is 150 mpg-e () and 122 mpg-e () in highway. With these ratings, the Ioniq Electric became in November 2016 the most efficient EPA certified vehicle considering all fuels and of all years, surpassing the 2014\u20132016 model year BMW i3, and also the 2017 Toyota Prius Prime, the most energy efficient plug in hybrid in EV mode. The 2017 Ioniq Electric has a combined EPA rated range of. Charging time is rated at 4 hours on a Level 2 fast charger (240\u00a0V). The range under the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC) standard is, and  under the South Korean cycle. The plug-in hybrid variant was released in February 2017. It has an 8. 9 kWh lithium-ion polymer battery (LiPo) capable of delivering  in all-electric mode (18 miles in real world highway use). The Ioniq Plug-in combines a 45\u00a0kW (61 PS) electric motor and 1. 6-L GDI four cylinder Kappa engine with 40% thermal efficiency capable of delivering. Hyundai expects the Ioniq Plug-in to achieve a combined EPA rating of  in all-electric mode. EPA all electric range is 29 miles. The Ioniq Plug-in has the same dual-clutch transmission as the hybrid variant. This is an important differentiator for Hyundai from the majority of other hybrid and plug-in hybrid cars that use a continuously variable transmission, which have been criticized for their poor acceleration performance. Enhancing the Ioniq Plug-in fuel efficiency and dynamic driving characteristics, the driver can select either SPORT or ECO modes. The SPORT function holds lower gears longer and combines power from the engine and electric motor for maximum performance. In ECO mode, the dual clutch transmission optimizes gear selection for efficiency, upshifting earlier to achieve better fuel economy. By January 2018, the Ioniq had surpassed 106,300 units sold worldwide, including over 73,800 conventional hybrids and nearly 25,000 purely electric cars, as well as over 5,500 plug-in hybrid variants (which had been on sale for three months).\n",

        "reference": " 17th century. He was an experienced soldier and fought for the king during the Fronde before becoming a naval captain. Towards the end of the Franco-Dutch War he led the land forces that took Tobago from the Dutch before taking command of the French Antilles. During the Nine Years' War he was active in the struggle with the English and Dutch in the Windward Islands. He captured Sint Eustatius and Saint Kitts, and defended Martinique against a large English expedition in 1693. Charles de Bl\u00e9nac, Marquis de la Roche-Courbon, was born to a noble family in 1622 in Romegoux, Saintonge. His parents were Jacques de Courbon Bl\u00e9nac and Marie Thison, dame de La Sauzaie. His sister Marie married Andr\u00e9 de Talleyrand-P\u00e9rigord. Charles de Bl\u00e9nac married Ang\u00e9lique de La Rochefoucauld, daughter of Louis de la Rochefoucauld, seigneur de Bay\u00e8res. She was the widow of his cousin. They would have eleven children. During the Fronde rebellion (1648\u201353) Bl\u00e9nac supported the infant King Louis XIV of France, and in recognition of his services was made count of Bl\u00e9nac in 1659. For a long time he served in the land armies, reaching the rank of mar\u00e9chal de camp. In 1669 he transferred to the navy, which was then in the process of being formed. He advanced quickly through the ranks and became capitaine de vaisseau. He commanded the Infante in the expedition of Jean II d'Estr\u00e9es against the Barbary pirates. He commanded the Fort in the Battle of Solebay in 1672. Bl\u00e9nac was quick to take offense, and early in 1673 was briefly imprisoned for insulting a superior officer. After his release, in August 1673 he was captain of Fortun\u00e9 in the Battle of Texel. The Franco-Dutch War began in 1672 and lasted until the Treaties of Nijmegen in 1678. In the Action of March 1677 a French force under Admiral Jean II d'Estr\u00e9es attempted to take the Dutch fortress of Sterrshans on Tobago but was repulsed. D'Estrees entered Klip Bay at dawn on 3 March 1677 in his flagship, the 72-gun Glorieux, accompanied by the 58-gun Pr\u00e9cieux, 46-gun \u00c9merillon and 38-gun Laurier. His second in command Louis Gabaret in the 56-gun Intr\u00e9pide led a squadron nearer to the shore that included the 62-gun Fendant commanded by Bl\u00e9nac and four smaller ships. The French engaged an arc of anchored Dutch warships, under-manned since the Dutch had transferred many men to the land defenses. French land forces attempted to storm fort Sterreschans but were repulsed on three separate attempts. The struggling ships in the harbour began to burn, with fire spreading from one ship to another. Eventually the French had to break off after three ships had been burned to the waterline, two run ashore and other badly damaged, with over 1,000 casualties. D'Estree withdrew toward Grenada and was back in France by early July. During the retreat to Grenada the French heard of the death of  Jean-Charles de Baas, and Bl\u00e9nac was  appointed to replace him as lieutenant general of the Antilles (lieutenant-g\u00e9n\u00e9ral des isles d\u2019Am\u00e9rique). He returned to France with D'Estr\u00e9es to have his appointment confirmed. Louis XIV decided to mount another expedition against Tobago later in 1677. Bl\u00e9nac and returned with d'Estrees in the autumn of 1677, taking office in November. On 3 October 1677 d'Estr\u00e9es left Brest for the West Indies with a squadron of seven ships of the line, four smaller ships, five en fl\u00fbte ships and four fireships. It was the strongest naval force that France had ever sent to the Americas. D'Estr\u00e9es had the 68-gun Terrible as his flagship. His second in command was Fran\u00e7ois-B\u00e9n\u00e9dict de Rouxel(fr), marquis de Grancey in the 64-gun Tonnant, and Bl\u00e9nac commanded the 60-gun Belliqueux. Bl\u00e9nac had instructions to coordinate his action as governor general with d'Estr\u00e9es, and to recruit soldiers and colonists as reinforcements. The squadron sailed to the Cape Verde Islands, took the slaving island of Gor\u00e9e (off Senegal) from the Dutch, then sailed fast to the Antilles. D'Estr\u00e9es stopped briefly at Barbados to find out what he could about the strength of the Dutch, then reached Tobago on 6 December 1677. Bl\u00e9nac led the land force of 950 men, with an artillery train to besiege the Dutch fort. The mortars and cannon had to be dragged about  to the top of a hill that overlooked the fort, which took three days. The third shell fired by the French hit the powder magazine, and the explosion destroyed the fort. 250 men died, including Admiral Jacob Binckes and 16 officers. The French attacked at once and within an hour had seized what remained of the fort as well as four sinking ships. They took 600 prisoners. The French destroyed all the houses and plantation buildings on the island, deported the people and abandoned the island. This victory destroyed Dutch military power in the Antilles. D'Estr\u00e9es next sailed to Martinique to prepare an attack on Cura\u00e7ao. Bl\u00e9nac raised a large contingent of buccaneers to support this expedition. During Bl\u00e9nac's time in office as governor general of the Antilles he devoted much of his energy to developing the city of Fort Royal, Martinique, which de Baas had established as the seat of the lieutenant general of the Antilles. He chose to live at Fort-Royal instead of Saint-Pierre to encourage growth of the town and the fortress. Before this the town had been an unplanned cluster of buildings along the Car\u00e9nage River. Bl\u00e9nac ordered the bogs around the site to be drained or filled in, making room for a grid of streets centered on a main square known as the Savane (Swamp). He began construction of a church and strengthened the defenses of the citadel. In 1680 Bl\u00e9nac accused the governor of Saint Croix of illegally welcoming foreign traders, particularly those selling slaves. In 1682 Jean-Baptiste Colbert appointed his first cousin Michel B\u00e9gon as intendant of the French colonies in the Caribbean, head of the civil and legal administration. He was charged with preparing an ordinance to regulated slavery in these colonies. B\u00e9gon sailed for Martinique that fall, where Bl\u00e9nac showed him what had been done so far on codifying the slave laws. B\u00e9gon spent the next three months studying all the slave ordinances of the French islands, then talked with leading officials and slave owners of Martinique, Guadeloupe and Saint Christophe. He condensed his findings into a 16-page memorandum that was sent to Versailles in February 1683 and became the basis, with a few small adjustments, of the March 1685 edict known as the Code Noir (Black Code). The king had asked Bl\u00e9nac to participate in drafting the slave code, but he claimed to have done little, and said only that Begin constructed the law \"in his presence\". He did help make some provisions concerning slaves milder and more flexible. Bl\u00e9nac left the Martinique for France in March 1683, and returned in April 1684. Claude de Roux de Saint-Laurent, chevalier de Saint-Laurent, acted as governor in his absence. Just before the start of the Nine Years' War, in October 1688 the navy secretary, the marquis de Seignelay informed Bl\u00e9nac and the island governors to prepare to defend themselves against Spain, since war with Spain was likely once Louis XIV declared war on the Dutch Republic. The governors were to inspect their fortifications, prepare artillery batteries, and make their militias and local defense forces ready to fight. France would give no support other than send two privateers from Saint-Malo to attack Dutch ships. At the start of the Nine Years' War (1688\u201397), in November 1688 Seignelay told Bl\u00e9nac to attack Sint Eustatius, to the northwest of Saint Christophe, destroy the island's fort and deport all the inhabitants. He was to use local forces only, and to cover the costs by selling slaves. The minister changed his mind when he heard that several large Dutch privateers were leaving for the Antilles, and before year end he heard that privateers were pillaging some of the small and indefensible French islands. In March 1689 Seignelay sent the 52-gun Perle to Martinique, and after Louis XIV declared war on Spain in April 1689 he sent the frigates Mignon and Friponne to the Antilles to defend the colonies and the French traders, and to attack the Dutch privateers. When England declared war on France in May 1689 Seignelay placed four warships at the disposal of Bl\u00e9nac. Bl\u00e9nac also used buccaneers as auxiliaries, particularly during the start of the war in 1689 during attacks on Saint Kitts and Sint Eustatius. In the West Indies the English would not cooperate with the Dutch, their allies. Bl\u00e9nac took advantage of this, and sent a secret expedition that captured Sint Eustatius. On 28 March 1689 a small fleet of three ships, a brigantine, a bark and three smaller vessels under Bl\u00e9nac  and the Intendant Gabriel Dumaitz de Goimpy was joined by another ship at Guadeloupe. At Saint Christopher (Saint Kitts) they were joined by three brigantines and three barks. With 17 vessels and 1,200 men Bl\u00e9nac  set course for the Dutch island of Sint Eustatius, where he arrived on 3 April 1689. The Dutch under Governor Lucas Schorer were totally unprepared for the attack, and just two ships managed to escape carrying valuables. The French landed at two places on the island, and after slight resistance the Dutch retreated into Fort Orange in the evening. The next morning, after the French threatened the fort with siege guns the Dutch surrendered and agreed to leave the island. The French destroyed all shore defenses, collected booty and departed, leaving a small 40-man garrison. In July 1689 Bl\u00e9nac heard that there were violent disagreements on Saint Kitts between supporters of King William III of England and Irish Jacobites. On 27 July 1689, after the dispatch vessel Perle had brought news that England and France were at war, Bl\u00e9nac  sailed from Martinique with the warships Hasardeux, \u00c9merillon, Loire, Dauphine and Cheval Marin, 14 merchantmen and 23 sloops. He arrived at Basseterre on the French part of Saint Christopher and landed his army, which quickly occupied all the south of the island. The English governor, Colonel Thomas Hill, took refuge with 400 to 500 defenders in Fort Charles. Bl\u00e9nac  settled down for a siege, and for two weeks bombarded the main gate with over 1,000 rounds, achieving little, while a trench was being dug towards the fort. The naval officer Jean-Baptiste du Casse then obtained permission to install a battery on  nearby hill from which the interior of the fort could be seen. This was done on the night of 14\u201315 August. When the fort's defenders found their gunfire could not reach the new, higher battery they surrendered. The Englist colonists were all ordered to evacuate to Nevis, and their Irish vassals were freed. Bl\u00e9nac  sailed for Martinique ten days later leaving Charles de Pechpeyrou-Comminges de Guitaut as governor. In response, the English attacked and captured Saint Barth\u00e9lemy, plundered the island of slaves, cattle and other goods, and burned all the houses. They made an attempt on Saint Martin that was driven off, then made a highly destructive raid on Marie-Galante. The French learned that the English governor Sir Christopher Codrington was planning to lead a force of about 2,300 to attack Martinique, and was waiting for warships to be fitted out in England to carry his force. Early in 1690 Bl\u00e9nac received over 30 merchantmen escorted by four warships, but chose to take no action against the English, and did not even have the resources to defend his recent conquests. Subordinates such as Ducasse were so critical of Bl\u00e9nac's lack of action that he offered to resign. Bl\u00e9nac left Martinique on 29 January 1690 and returned to France \"on leave\" on the Pont d'Or to defend himself at court. By July the British had reconquered Saint Kitts and Sint Eustatius. Bl\u00e9nac's successor Fran\u00e7ois d'Alesso, Marquis d'\u00c9ragny arrived on 5 February 1691 with 14 warships, strengthened the defenses and in May relieved the French defenders of Fort Saint-Charles in Guadeloupe, who had been besieged by the English. On his return to Martinique d'Eragny was among the victims of an outbreak of yellow fever in August 1691. Louis XIV sent Jean-Baptiste du Casse to help defend the Antilles late in 1691. The king reappointed Bl\u00e9nac as governor general of the Windward Islands. The comte de Pontchartrain gave Bl\u00e9nac a fleet of ten warships, one frigate and two fire ships. He was ordered to attack Barbados and go on to destroy the property of the English colonists in the Leeward Islands. Bl\u00e9nac arrived back in Martinique on 4 February 1692. On 2 March 1692 a convoy of merchant ships escorted by Commodore Ralph Wrenn was passing between Guadeloupe and D\u00e9sirade. The English found Bl\u00e9nac ahead of them in his flagship, the 62-gun Vermandois, supported by the Vaillant, L\u00e9ger, Fran\u00e7ois, Droite, Basque, Chasseur, Solide, Bouffone, Jersey, Neptune'' and five smaller vessels. The English were completely outnumbered, and set a course to the leeward in the hope of protecting the convoy. Bl\u00e9nac engaged the next day, but Wrenn outmanoeuvred him and managed to escape to the south. Wrenn reached Barbados three days later without any losses. After this the English and French found themselves in a stalemate, where neither could risk invading an enemy island while the other's fleet was intact. The crews of both squadrons suffered from yellow fever, and Wrenn died of the disease. Bl\u00e9nac only had enough sailors to man three warships by the start of July. News came that the English were organizing a major expedition under Sir Francis Wheler to attach the French Antilles. Bl\u00e9nac was told he could not expect help from France. Bl\u00e9nac had been accompanied to Martinique by an engineer, Sieur de Caylus, and during 1692 he directed improvements to the island's defenses while Bl\u00e9nac organized the  militia of almost 1,400 men. Pontchartrain ordered that the five vessels of the French navy in the Antilles leave by 1 March 1693. In 1693 Bl\u00e9nac and the governor of Martinique, Nicolas de Gabaret, repulsed the English when they attempted invasion with a force of 4,000 men. The English expedition under Admiral Wheler had 15 warships 3 fire ships, 28 transports and almost 2,000 soldiers, to which Barbados added another 1,000 men. This force invaded in March 1693, and took control of a large area with little opposition. English reinforcements under Captain General Christopher Codrington arrived within two weeks, but the combined force did not engage in serious fighting. The English took 3,000 black slaves, valued at \u00a360,000. An ineffective attack was made on Saint Pierre, then the force departed. Various explanations have been given for the failure to make a serious effort to capture the island. The reason seems to be a combination of the climate, raw troops including unenthusiastic Irish and superior French forces. The French under Ducasse retaliated, but limited their activity to plundering. Bl\u00e9nac died near Fort Royal, Martinique on the night of 8-9 June 1696 from lingering dysentery. He was succeeded by the Thomas-Claude Renart de Fuchsamberg, marquis d'Amblimont.\n",

Its natural habitat is moist savanna, although it has also been shown to inhabit woodlands and coastal forests. These bats typically weight about 10\u00a0g, and have a low aspect ratio, as well as low wing loading. These bats typically have a rich brown mixed with grizzled silver coat of hair on top and grey or whitish hair underneath. The ears are proportionally large compared to their size and have rounded tips. They typically weigh between 6 and 9\u00a0g and are between 8. 3 and 10\u00a0cm long, with an average wingspan of 25\u00a0cm. A feature relatively unique to K. argentata is the fringe of hair on the outer edge of interfemoral membrane which stretches between its legs, as this hair is distinctive to this species. The echolocation for this species is a relatively low-intensity call that lasts about two milliseconds with a low frequency peak of around 90-118 kilohertz (kHz). These properties allow the bats to come as close as 3\u00a0m from its prey before the calls are detectable. As with several other Kerivoula species, the Damara woolly bat uses abandoned nests of weaverbirds and the scarlet-chested sunbird. Typically, the bats roost alone, but colonies can reach up to six members. The range of the bats extends across much of sub-Saharan Africa and has been identified in  Angola, Cote d'Ivoire, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Senegal, South Africa, Swaziland, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe.\n",

Oberndorf is famous worldwide as the birthplace of the carol Silent Night (German: Stille Nacht), which was first performed at the former St. Nikola parish church by the schoolmaster Franz Xaver Gruber and the young priest Joseph Mohr on Christmas Eve 1818, from where it spread out to the world. As in the 1890s several floods of the Salzach River destroyed large parts of Oberndorf, the church was finally demolished and a memorial chapel erected on its site in 1937. A full-scale replica of the memorial chapel, built in 1992, can be found in Frankenmuth, Michigan.

As the population of Jaffa swelled considerably in the late 19th century, the area attracted rich Arab families from Jaffa, as well as rich residents of other Arab towns, such as Jericho, Nablus and Jerusalem, who built their houses there, and the area became a suburb for the old city. During the British mandate, the area attracted British officers. During the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, the Arab residents of the area fled and the neighborhood remained mostly empty until it was settled by immigrants arriving from Europe. In the following years, the stronger population moved out of the neighborhood, leaving the weakened population in the neighborhood.

In Thailand the Lannathai kingdom was founded. In Japan, a new sect of Buddhism was formed, while in Korea the carving of Buddhist scriptures on 81,000 wooden blocks was completed. Europe noted several important cultural milestones, including the completion of several important cathedrals and the beginning of construction of others, as well as the founding of the Coll\u00e8ge de Sorbonne at the University of Paris. Significant political developments in Europe included the lack of a Holy Roman Emperor for most of the decade, further erosion of the power of the monarchy in England and Portugal, the end of the failed Seventh Crusade in Egypt, and the expulsion of the Jews from France and the Moors from Portugal. In religion, a papal bull authorized the use of torture in the Medieval Inquisition, and the Roman Catholic Church clarified the concept of purgatory. Several important modern cities, including Stockholm and Lviv, were founded in the 1250s. One of the largest volcanic eruptions of the Holocene epoch is thought to have occurred circa January 1258, with ice cores pointing to a tropical location such as El Chich\u00f3n, Mexico or possibly Quilotoa, Ecuador.

        "reference": " fifth generation of this Australian-made model and also included the Ford Fairmont (EF)\u2014the luxury-oriented version of the Falcon. The Ford EF Falcon was introduced in August 1994. It was a significant facelift of the Ford Falcon (ED), which it replaced. All exterior panels other than the doors were new for the EF, while Fairmont and Fairmont Ghia now had unique frontal styling differentiating them from the Falcon models. An upgraded EF Series II range was introduced in October 1995. The EF Series also saw the first use of polycarbonate headlight lenses instead of glass, saving weight and gaining shatter resistance. The EF range started with the GLi and Futura. GLi models were available in sedan and wagon, appealing most to fleet buyers and family buyers respectively. GLi models offered 15-inch wheels, body-coloured front and rear bumpers except insert mouldings, drivers airbag as standard, and the 5-speed manual was standard with 4. 0-litre SOHC (single over head cam) inline six-cylinder, while a 5. 0-litre V8 and four-speed automatic was optional. The Futura shared the overall styling of the GLi and had the same engine and transmission options. While the Futura benefited from exterior differences such as body-coloured mirrors, bumpers and different wheel covers. The Futura was feature-rich, having front power windows, cruise control, ABS, rear headrests, interior map pockets standard, map lights, six-speaker audio system (six-stacker optional), a digital clock, variable intermittent wipers, fold-out rear-seat armrest and interior grab handles. All of the base models offered an optional Tickford body kit, boot mounted spoiler with integrated stop light, a choice of 15- or 16-inch alloy wheels, six-stacker CD player (except GLi), disabled drivers pack and airbag compatible 'Smart Bar' bull-bar. The sport range comprised the XR6, which was available in both sedan and wagon, and the XR8, which was only available in a sedan. Both XR6 and XR8 had bold exterior styling similar to previous XR Falcons, featuring twin headlamps and red or black bumper strips (depending on the body colour) and unique 15-inch alloy wheels. All XR models had the features of the Futura plus their own features, including Tickford reprogrammed gear changes for the electronically controlled four-speed auto, Tickford developed sports suspension which included lower springs and upgraded swaybars, rear spoiler with built-in brake light standard on both wagons and sedans (rear-window-mounted stop light still present but disabled), limited slip differential standard with a lower ratio for increased acceleration, adjustable see-through sports front and rear headrests, 'Sports' front bucket seats with side bolsters, oil pressure and battery voltage gauges, 'Charcoal' leather-wrapped steering wheel, low oil pressure and washer fluid low warning lights, dual horn note. The XR6 had the same 4. 0-litre SOHC (single over head cam) inline six-cylinder as the base models but with Tickford alloy cylinder heads, a Tickford spec cam along with higher pressure valve springs and unique EEC programming to make the most of the changes made to the engine. A press bent 2. 5-inch exhaust was also added, a minor upgrade over the standard 2. 25-inch system. The XR6 delivers  at 5000 rpm up from  in the ED Falcon. The XR8 has a 5. 0-litre OHV (over head valve) V8 delivering  at 4500 rpm up from the. LPG was not offered as a factory option on the XR6 and XR8 models. Transmissions available were a five-speed manual as standard and a four-speed auto which is electronically controlled and tuned by Tickford. Luxury models in the EF Falcon range were not branded as Falcon; they were branded either a Ford Fairmont or Ford Fairmont Ghia. The Fairmont was based on the Futura and had all the features of the Futura but added a trip computer, climate control as standard, adjustable steering wheel, Remote Boot Release, Remote Keyless Entry, central locking and 15-inch alloy wheels. The Fairmont Ghia added a nine-speaker audio system, boot mounted 6 CD stacker, subwoofer and Ghia badging. Both the Fairmont and Fairmont Ghia models had chrome accents, differently designed headlights, bonnets and front bar, and were the only model in the EF Falcon range to have a grille (albeit non-functional). four-speed automatic transmission was standard across the Fairmont lineup and had the option of the 4. 0-litre SOHC (single over head cam) inline six-cylinder or a 5. 0-litre OHV (over head valve) V8. The six-cylinder Ghia version received the motor out of the XR6. The difference in power output is attributed to the quieter exhaust system fitted to the Ghia rather than the higher flowing system of the XR. The Series II was introduced in October 1995 adding over 1000 new features and eliminated the XR6 wagon from the range. A new front suspension was introduced due to criticism that it was too \"nervous\" when handling, another major improvement was the standardisation of a passenger airbag (except the GLi but it was a no cost option). Series II EF Falcons are identifiable by revised hubcaps on the GLi model, revised body side rub strips on the Futura, and black B-pillars on the Fairmont Ghia. All EF II Falcons feature a wide-angle convex passenger side door mirror. When the Series II EF Falcon was released two special editions were made available. A Classic option pack was offered on GLi and Futura sedans and wagons from November 1995 to March 1996 and an Olympic Classic pack was offered on the same models from May 1996 to August 1996. A total of 192,100 EF models were produced prior to replacement of the EF by the Ford Falcon (EL) in 1996.\n",

The settlement most probably grew as a fishing island in its own right, drying and curing fish on Hoswick beach, then many residents subsequently worked from the nearby fishing station on the mainland at Broonie's Taing which was at its height in the early 1900s but had declined by the late 1930s. Hoswick isle was also home to a Shetland tweed weaving industry post WW2, but this came to an end in the 1980s and the Visitor Centre (cafe and museum) is housed in one of the former weaving sheds. The tweed industry was developed by LJ Smith, who also built up a substantial knitwear industry based on home knitters but served from premises in Hoswick. According to John Stewart(P294) the name derives from the Old Norse Hausv\u00edk and means \"skull\" in light of the steep hills adjacent in the area. The residents of Hoswick are known for a legal case following the annual whale drive when, in 1888, they drove around 340 whales ashore. They then resisted the landowner, John Bruce Jnr of Sumburgh's claim for a third share of the profits which was customary under Udal Law (the catch was traditionally split three ways, one for the 'admiral', one for those who drove the whales ashore and one for the owner of the land on which the animals were beached). The case was heard at the Court of Session in Edinburgh (Bruce v Smith) and in July 1889 Sheriff MacKenzie found in the Hoswick residents' favour. The court refused to recognise Bruce's claim, saying it was not 'sufficiently inveterate, uniform, or uninterrupted'. Bruce appealed the decision in 1890 but lost, and no further claims were made by Shetland landowners. Heavy rains in the early morning of 19 September 2003 caused extensive flash flood damage to the village with many buildings affected (eleven houses were flooded, two of which had to be evacuated), the Hoswick bridge destroyed, a large section of the beach swept away and fresh water supplies cut off (two kilometres of water main were destroyed, resulting in the community having to rely on bottled water for several days). Hoswick Visitor Centre - contains a cafe, gift shop, weaving exhibits, interpretative local history displays and a large collection of vintage radios. Hoswick Woollen Mill - a working factory and shop which houses Laurance Odie Knitwear. The company was started by Laurence Odie in early 2004 following the closure of Laurence J. Smith Ltd which was based in the same premises. Hoswick contains many examples of the traditional two-story, two or three-bay croft houses that are particularly associated with the district.\n",

        "reference": "\u201312th century by the Khitan people, who had created the Liao Empire in north-eastern China. In addition to the small script, the Khitans simultaneously also used a functionally independent writing system known as the Khitan large script. Both Khitan scripts continued to be in use to some extent by the Jurchens for several decades after the fall of the Liao Dynasty, until the Jurchens fully switched to a script of their own. Examples of the scripts appeared most often on epitaphs and monuments, although other fragments sometimes surface. The Khitan small script was invented in about 924 or 925 CE by a scholar named Yel\u00fc Diela. He drew his inspiration from \u201cthe Uyghur language and script,\u201d  which he was shown by a visiting Uyghur ambassador at the Khitan court. For this reason, Khitan small script was originally thought to be a daughter script of the Old Uyghur alphabet. Using a smaller number of symbols than large script, small script was less complex, yet still \u201cable to record any word\u201d. While small-script inscriptions employed some logograms as well, most words in small script were made using a blocked system reminiscent of the later Hangul writing of Korea, meaning that a word is represented by one group (square block) composed of several glyphs with individual phonetic meanings (somewhat similar to the jamo units of Hangul). Unlike Hangul's jamo, a Khitan phonetic symbol could represent not just a single vowel or consonant, but a CV or VC pair as well. Each block could incorporate two to seven such \"phonetic element\" characters, written in pairs within the block, with the first half of the pair on the left. If there were an odd number of characters in a block, the unpaired character would be centered below the preceding pair. Although there is some speculation, it appears there are no characters that both the small and large scripts share. Periodically, epitaphs written using small script will be written using the large script method of linearity. Although small script had some similarities to Chinese, Khitan characters were often used to record Chinese words. The appearance of a likeness between a small script and a Chinese character does not help in the reading of Khitan. For example, the  Chinese character for \u2018mountain\u2019 (\u5c71) is the same as the Khitan small script logogram for \u2018gold\u2019 (and, thus, the name of the Jin Dynasty). Of the 378 known small script characters, 125 are semantic, 115 are phonetic, and the remainder have not been deciphered. (Usually, it was possible to guess the phonetic value of an element if it has been used to transcribe a Chinese loanword in a Khitan inscription; otherwise, such phonetic values are hard to determine, as very little of the Khitan language is known. Small script uses a mixture of logograms, syllabograms, and, as some as sources claim, a few single sound phonograms. Sometimes suffixes were written with syllabograms, just as single syllables sometimes were written with three syllabograms (with one each for the initial, medial, and final sounds of the syllable). Sometimes the initial consonants of syllables are indicated to be dental, labial, guttural, or nasal etc., based on the syllabograms involved. Additionally, vowels are sometimes indicated to be labial or non-labial, or pronounced in the front or back of the mouth. Much of this information came from the \"Khitan Script Research Group\", led by the Mongolian scholar named \u010cinggeltei,  who used monuments, calendar, and similar Chinese texts to decipher sections of small script. A particularly valuable object of their study was the inscription on the Da Jin huangdi dotong jingl\u00fce langjun xingji (\u5927\u91d1\u7687\u5e1d\u90fd\u7d71\u7d93\u7565\u90ce\u541b\u884c\u8a18) stele, which is the only known bilingual Chinese-Khitan inscription. Produced during the Jurchen Jin Dynasty it, ironically, was originally (before the discovery of other Khitan inscriptions in 1922) thought to be in Jurchen. There are no surviving examples of printed texts in the Khitan language, and aside from five example Khitan large characters with Chinese glosses in a book on calligraphy written by Tao Zongyi (\u9676\u5b97\u5100) during the mid 14th century, there are no Chinese glossaries or dictionaries of Khitan. The main source of Khitan texts are monumental inscriptions, mostly comprising memorial tablets buried in the tombs of Khitan nobility. There are about 33 known monuments with inscriptions in the Khitan small script, ranging in date from 1053 to 1171. The Khitan small script was added to Unicode version 13. 0 in March 2020. 470 graphic characters are located in the Khitan Small Script block, while a single invisible filler character () is located in the Ideographic Symbols and Punctuation block.\n",

        "reference": " Medina. He is a five-time world featherweight champion. His nickname is \"Mantecas\", which can be loosely translated to \"lard\". Manuel Medina began his professional boxing career on September 9, 1985, beating Daniel Flores by a four-round decision in Mexicali, Mexico. Medina was only fourteen years old when his first professional fight took place. Medina won one more fight, then lost two bouts in a row: on December 5, he lost a four-round decision to Gerardo Martinez in his first fight abroad, held in San Jose, California, United States. On January 16, 1986, he suffered his first knockout defeat, being stopped because of a cut by Alex Madrid in San Diego. After losing to Madrid, Medina had a streak of twenty seven wins in a row. That streak was stopped by Juan C. Salazar, who outpointed Medina over ten rounds on July 10, 1989, in Tijuana. After two more victories, however, Medina contended for his first championship belt, the regional WBA \"International\" super featherweight title, which he won by a seventh round disqualification victory against Edgar Castro, on December 11 of that same year, in Inglewood. Medina retained that title twice, then defeated Tyrone Jackson on May 21, 1990, also at Inglewood by a twelve-round decision. In his next fight on 5 July, he outpointed former world featherweight champion and Barry McGuigan conqueror, Steve Cruz over ten rounds. Medina won four bouts, then had his first chance at becoming a world champion, when, on August 12, 1991, he faced IBF featherweight champion Troy Dorsey in Inglewood. Medina was knocked down twice early, but became a world champion by getting up and defeating Dorsey by a twelve-round decision. He made four defenses of his title, including victories against Tom Johnson, beaten by a nine rounds technical decision and Fabrice Benichou, another world champion boxer, outpointed by Medina over twelve rounds. His first reign as world featherweight champion took him to places like France and Italy. Medina lost the championship to Johnson by a twelve-round decision on their February 26, 1993 rematch, held in France. He turned to the super featherweight division, where he won one fight, then attempted to become world champion there also. But, on June 26 of the same year, he lost to IBF super featherweight champion John John Molina by a twelve-round decision, in Atlantic City. Medina then returned to featherweight, where he won two more fights before facing Johnson in a rubber match, held on January 28, 1995 at Atlantic City. Johnson retained the IBF featherweight title he had won from Medina by beating him via a twelve-round decision. In his next fight, Medina won the WBC's regional Fecarbox title by defeating Juan Polo Perez by a twelve-round unanimous decision on March 15 in Miami, Florida. Medina's next fight was televised nationally in the United States, as he became world Featherweight champion for the second time, defeating Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez on September 23 of '95, with a twelve-round unanimous decision, at Sacramento, California, for the WBC featherweight title. He lost the title in his first defense, losing a twelve-round decision to Luisito Espinosa on December 11 at Tokyo, Japan. After a win, Medina tried to become a three time world featherweight champion by challenging Naseem Hamed for Hamed's WBO title, but he was defeated by Hamed with an eleventh-round knockout on August 31, 1996 in Dublin, Ireland. He followed that loss with a win, and another attempt at winning a world featherweight championship for a third time, this time around in a rematch with Espinosa. held on May 17, 1997. He lost to the Asian champion, this time by an eight rounds technical decision at Intramuros, Philippines. Medina then lost his next fight, by a ninth-round knockout on August 7, to future world champion Derrick Gainer. On October 18, he recovered from his two loss streak to defeat Jose Ayala in Homestead, Florida, winning the WBA's Fedecentro regional championship, and setting himself in a position to obtain another chance at winning the world featherweight title for the third time. He knocked Ayala out in the eighth round. On April 24, 1998, Medina joined Carlos De Le\u00f3n, Muhammad Ali, Sugar Ray Robinson, Edwin Rosario, Evander Holyfield and a small number of other boxers in the exclusive group of fighters to reign as world champions three or more times in the same division, when he outpointed defending IBF title holder Hector Lizarraga over twelve rounds in San Jose, California. He retained the title on April 16, 1999, in Las Vegas with a nine rounds technical decision over former world super featherweight champion Victor Polo, then proceeded to lose the championship to Paul Ingle. The fight against Ingle, held on November 13 of the same year, in Hull, England, went on to be considered one of the fights of the year by boxing fans, experts and magazine writers alike. Floored in the second and tenth rounds, Medina almost saved his title when he dropped Ingle in the twelfth and last round. He ended up losing a unanimous decision, however. Medina then met future world champion Frank Toledo, beating him in Las Vegas by a ten-round decision on May 19, 2000. Toledo then went on to win the IBF title by outpointing Mbulelo Botile, who had defeated Ingle. Medina, meanwhile, picked up two more wins, including a fourth-round knockout over future world title challenger Mike Juarez. Medina and Toledo had a rematch on November 16, 2001, with Medina joining Robinson as a four-time world champion in the same division when he knocked Toledo out in the sixth round. His next fight was filled with controversy. Faced against former two division world champion Johnny Tapia on April 27, 2002, Medina lost the title by a twelve-round majority decision at the Madison Square Garden in New York City. The decision was criticized for months to come by writers from such publications as Ring and KO Magazine. The official scorecards reflected a very close fight, with two judges scoring it 115-113 for Tapia and a third scoring the fight a 114-114 tie. Medina's first attempt at tying Robinson's record as the only boxer to win a world title in the same division five times came on February 1, 2003, when he and Juan Manuel M\u00e1rquez faced off in Las Vegas for the IBF championship vacated by Tapia. Medina was knocked out in the seventh round by Marquez, however. After two more wins, Medina got his second chance at becoming world featherweight champion for the fifth time against WBO champion Scott Harrison. The two boxers fought for the first time on July 12 at the Braehead Arena in Glasgow, Scotland. Medina made history and joined Robinson as the only two fighters in history to be five-time world champions in the same division, by defeating Harrison, who until then had been defeated only once, by a twelve-round split decision. A boxing magazine from the United States then called Medina the gambler's nightmare, because of his tendency to win world featherweight titles, lose them quickly, then regain them just as quick. Medina and Harrison were rematched on November 29 of the same year, and Harrison regained the WBO  title with an eleventh-round knockout of Medina, again, at the Braehead Arena in Glasgow. Medina only fought once in 2004, defeating Leonardo Resendiz on July 23 at Rancho Mirage, California by a third-round knockout, to win the WBA's regional NABA super featherweight title. He was to fight Jos\u00e9 Miguel Cotto on August 20, 2005 in Ponce, Puerto Rico. Had he beaten Cotto, he would have put himself in a position to challenge for the WBO super featherweight title. Cotto was not able to reduce weight to the super featherweight weight limit, however, so the fight was suspended. On 31-05-2006 he fought Cassius Baloyi for the IBF super featherweight title, the same title he'd challenged Molina for back in 1993, and lost by 11th-round TKO. Medina returned to outpoint Kevin Kelley by a twelve-round majority decision, then fought a rematch with Baloyi on 05-07-2007 which was scored a technical draw after Medina suffered a cut from an accidental clash of heads.

The hall was built in 1922 by the Trinity Methodist Episcopal Church as a temporary sanctuary while their new church was built. It later functioned as a social hall for the church. Since it was located in close proximity to town schools, it was used as overflow space. The town used the hall as a polling place until at least 1955. The American Legion bought the building in 1935, after the church congregation abandoned their church project. Although a much larger community center was built by the town with a WPA grant in 1936, the Legion Hall remained popular for smaller gatherings and for events that featured a speaker. Organizations as diverse as the railroad union and the Odd Fellows met there. In later years it was used for day care, until 1995, and used for storage after that. In 2015 work started on plans for rehabilitation of the structure. The Legion Hall is a simple framed building, about  by, with a gabled roof. The gables are clad in wood shingles, while the body of the building is sheathed in closely lapping clapboards. A tightly arranged grouping of windows flanks the main entrance at the gable end, facing the street on the east side. Five evenly spaced windows line the south elevation, and the west elevation is blank except for a small window in the gable. An annex measuring  by  covers much of the north elevation, housing accessory spaces. The main hall is about twelve feet in height and was originally covered in lath and plaster. Poor structural performance of the original scissor trusses led to the installation of columns in the main hall to support the roof.

The station operates on the FM radio frequency of 96. 3\u00a0MHz and airs a classic rock format. 96. 3 FM began operations as WKQM in April 1994, featuring an easy listening/adult standards music format. In September 1995, WKQM changed its format to modern rock and adopted the moniker \"The Edge,\" with new calls WEJE. \"The Edge\" was consulted by noted rock radio consultant Fred Jacobs, but after Jacobs Media and WEJE parted ways in January 1998, WEJE rebranded as \"Extreme 96. 3\". In March 2001, the \"Extreme\" format and WEJE calls moved to new sign-on 102. 3 FM in Auburn, Indiana (now WGBJ), and on March 12, 2001, 96. 3 debuted a new country music format as WWWD, originally tagged \"Big Red Country\" but then changed to \"Red Hot Country\" after Artistic Media Partners notified 96. 3's then-owner, Frank Kovas, that the name \"Big Red Country\" was already service-marked for their station in Ellettsville. On March 1, 2002, following Kovas' sale of his stations to Travis Broadcasting Corporation the previous December, \"Red Hot Country\" was blown up in favor of WHTD \"Hits 96,\" a CHR/Pop station. On April 5, 2004, after stunting with \"Wild Thing\" by Tone Loc for a day, 96. 3 flipped to an urban-leaning Rhythmic CHR format, branded as \"Wild 96. 3\", and changed call letters to WNHT. The station was purchased by Summit City Radio Group in July 2004. In March 2014, Adams Radio Group entered an agreement to purchase Summit City's cluster (which includes WNHT). Days later, Adams announced they would purchase Oasis Radio Group's stations. To meet ownership limits, Adams will retain WNHT, WGL and WXKE, as well as acquiring Oasis Radio Group's WJFX and WBTU, while selling off WHPP to Fort Wayne Catholic Radio, and selling WGL-FM to Calvary Radio Network. WLYV and two translators (on 96. 9 FM and 103. 3 FM) will also be acquired by Adams. The purchase, at a price of $6. 4 million, was consummated on June 2, 2014. As a result, Adams plans on massive format restructuring. WNHT's entire airstaff were released on May 30, leading to rumors of a format change. On June 2, Adams announced that WXKE will move to the stronger 96. 3 signal on June 11.

In early 20th century, the French doctor Jos Jullien discovered mineral thermal spring waters under Pyrenees mountain in the southern part of France which contained thermal plankton, supposedly a key to healthy skin and a potent skin rejuvenator. In 1952, intellectual property rights was acquired and she used it in skin care products. Thus, therm in Biotherm comes from thermal plankton, an ingredient found in all Biotherm products. Bio comes from the profession of the founder biologist. In the years 1940-50, Dr. Jos Jullien, from Joyeuse in Ardeche (France), noticed the presence of a particular substance on the surface of the thermal waters of Molitg-les-Bains. This substance is composed of thermal plankton. With Jeanine Marissal, he works on the potentials of this substance that they integrate with a cosmetic formula. Biotherm was born from this work in 1952, under the leadership of Adrien Barth\u00e9l\u00e9my, owner of the Molitg-les-Bains springs. In 1952, Biotherm launched 3 products: La Cr\u00e8me Triple-Usage, Biotherm Cure and Biomains. Biomains, a hands moisturizing cream, is still on the market today. In 1955, 3 years after the creation Biotherm, The New York Times noticed this new French brand: \"Plankton is used as aid to beauty\". In 1957, Biotherm started to build its hydration expertise with the launch of La Cr\u00e8me Hydrothermale. During the 1960s the brand developed several targeted skincare solutions to address specific needs, including its first sun cream and its first \"slimming cream\". In 1968, Biotherm introduces Bio-Buste Suractive on the market, its first \"breast firming cream\". Biotherm was acquired by  L'Or\u00e9al in 1970. In 1972, Biotherm launched Lait Corporel.

In 1974 Princess Grace of Monaco inaugurates Biotherm research center in Monaco with founder Jeanne Marissal and L'Or\u00e9al heiress Liliane Bettencourt. This center includes laboratories and production unit. In 1981, famous model Marie Hanson appears on Biotherm advertising campaign. In 1982 French skipper Florence Arthaud starts the Route du Rhum race with her trimaran BIOTHERM II, designed by Xavier Joubert. In 1984, Elle Macpherson becomes Biotherm ambassador. In 1985, Biotherm launches Biotherm Homme a range of men skincare. In the 1990s Biotherm entered the Asian markets while developing new products based on aquatic ingredients such as its Aquasource Gel formulated with plankton in 1998. Actress and model Rebecca Romijn appears on Biotherm campaigns. In 1994, Biotherm inaugurates a new biotechnology center to isolate and cultivate plankton extract (pure thermal plankton) in Tours, France. In 2002,  Biotherm Homme launches its oligo-thermal moisturizer Aquapower gel for men. In 2005 Taiwanese-Japanese actor Takeshi Kaneshiro becomes the face of Biotherm Homme in Asia. In 2009, American Sex & the City actor Chris Noth becomes Biotherm Homme ambassador.

        "reference": ". The game featured two legendary coaches, Knute Rockne of Notre Dame, and Pop Warner in his first year at Stanford. The game also featured the Four Horsemen of Notre Dame. Elmer Layden of Notre Dame and Ernie Nevers of Stanford were named the Rose Bowl Players Of The Game when the award was created in 1953 and selections were made retroactively. This was the first appearance for Notre Dame in any post season bowl game. It was the second appearance for Stanford in a bowl game, since their appearance in the First Tournament East West football game, later known as the 1902 Rose Bowl. This was the first appearance of the Notre Dame football team on the West Coast, and eventually led to the founding of the Notre Dame \u2013 USC rivalry. This game marked the first time a wirephoto, known at the time as a \"telepix\", was transmitted of a bowl game. At the time, the Pacific Coast Conference (PCC) teams played a very limited conference schedule. Teams played from three to five conference opponents in an eight-game schedule. Stanford defeated Occidental and had a narrow 7\u20130 win against Olympic Club. They defeated Oregon, 28\u201313, in their opening PCC conference game. A 3\u20130 victory over Idaho in Portland, Oregon was their last close game. Then they beat Montana, 41\u20133, to run their PCC record to 3\u20130. Stanford and the California Golden Bears met in one of the biggest of the Big Games in 1924. Both teams were undefeated with the PCC championship on the line. Stanford was 3\u20130, and Cal was 2\u20130\u20131. Thousands packed Tightwad Hill above a sold out California Memorial Stadium. Cal needed a win, but the game ended in a 20\u201320 tie, giving Stanford the sole possession of first place in the PCC. Notre Dame garnered interest from the Rose Bowl committee to play a PCC opponent for the 1925 football season. Rockne and the Notre Dame administration realized how lucrative an annual trip to Los Angeles would be for the football program. Notre Dame's west coast alumni began lobbying Rockne to bring the team to the Rose Bowl as a season finale on a yearly basis. The Rose Bowl committee favored this arrangement; at the time there was no tie in with the Big Ten Conference. However, the PCC had reservations. Specifically, two members schools, Stanford University and the University of California refused to play Notre Dame \"on account of [Notre Dame's] low scholastic standards. Since Notre Dame was a Catholic school, its academics were considered inferior at the time. USC's coach, Gus Henderson reached out to Rockne through correspondence stating that \"USC would welcome the chance to play Notre Dame New Year's Day in Pasadena. While Rockne favored playing USC, Stanford, which won the PCC title, had first choice and eventually realized that playing Notre Dame would be lucrative, and the two played in the 1925 Rose Bowl. Quarterback Harry Stuhldreher, left halfback Jim Crowley, right halfback Don Miller and fullback Elmer Layden had run rampant through Irish opponents' defenses since coach Knute Rockne devised the lineup in 1922 during their sophomore season. A legendary quote from Grantland Rice, a sportswriter for the former New York Herald Tribune, gave them football immortality. Outlined against a blue-gray October sky, the Four Horsemen rode again. In dramatic lore they are known as famine, pestilence, destruction and death. These are only aliases. Their real names are: Stuhldreher, Miller, Crowley and Layden. precipice at the Polo Grounds this afternoon as 55,000 spectators peered down upon the bewildering panorama spread out upon the green plain below. Notre Dame would later notch its 200th victory in a 34\u20133 win over Georgia Tech in the homecoming game on November 1, 1924. Their only other close game would come against Northwestern at Soldier Field on November 22, where the Irish won 13\u20136. Three Irish touchdowns were scored on Stanford turnovers. Stanford had eight, which proved to be the difference, as they otherwise dominated the Fighting Irish. Elmer Layden scored three touchdowns for Notre Dame, one on a three-yard run in the second quarter to give Notre Dame a 6\u20133 lead and two more on interception returns. Ernie Nevers, an All-American two-way star for Stanford, played all 60 minutes in the game. He rushed for 114 yards, more yardage than all the Four Horsemen combined. The next year, the USC invited Notre Dame to a home-and-home series, which was the beginning of the Notre Dame\u2013USC football rivalry. Previously, the furthest west the Irish ever had traveled was to play at Nebraska and Kansas. Dillon Hall, a dormitory at the University of Notre Dame, was built with the proceeds, $52,000, from the 1925 Rose Bowl. Elmer Layden of Notre Dame and Ernie Nevers of Stanford were named the Rose Bowl Players of the Game when the award was created in 1953 and selections were made retroactively. Notre Dame has never appeared in the Rose Bowl game again, and did not appear in any bowl game until the 1970 Cotton Bowl Classic. In 2007, the UCLA Bruins hosted the Notre Dame Fighting Irish in the Rose Bowl stadium where the Irish won, 20\u20136. With the Rose Bowl Game joining the Bowl Championship Series, the possibility has existed that Notre Dame could again play in the Rose Bowl game. Rockne died in a plane crash in 1931. Don Miller, who died in 1979 as the last of the living Four Horsemen, said that the 1925 Rose Bowl champion team was Rockne's favorite team. The Notre Dame\u2013Stanford football rivalry game is now one of the many Notre Dame Fighting Irish football rivalries. The teams next played each other in 1942 and again in 1963 and 1964. The modern series began in 1988 has been played annually except in 1995 and 1996. As of 2014, Notre Dame leads the series, 19\u201310. When the game is played at Stanford Stadium, it is usually the last game on Stanford's schedule (as has been the case since 1999), one week after the Cardinal plays archrival California in the Big Game.\n",

        "reference": "24 near the state border with Illinois. It is the only historic house in the United States also used as a rest area. The house was listed in the National Register of Historic Places on March 1, 1984. In 1865, tobacco dealer Edward L. Anderson completed construction of a simple two-story, brick farmhouse, the bricks for which had been fired in a pit on the grounds. The house remained in the Anderson family until sold to Ed L. Atkins in 1903. Atkins commissioned his friend, architect Alda Lafayette Lassiter to remodel the house in the Classical Revival style. Lassiter added a grand staircase, elaborate plaster ceilings with crown molding, and a large portico with eight Corinthian columns. The house was painted white, and Adkins named it Whitehaven. In 1908, after the death of Atkins' wife, Atkins sold the house to James P. Smith, mayor of Paducah. The Smiths made many changes, hiring Marshall Fields to do interior decorating. Smith added a storm shelter in the back yard and converted the attic into additional bedrooms for their six children. Nell Smith changed the name of the now-22-room house to \"Bide-A-Wee\" (\"Stay awhile\") to honor her Scottish heritage, and she and her daughter created formal gardens on the property. The last member of the Smith family moved out of the house in 1968, and it was left with caretakers who seem to have both abused the house and sold fixtures from it. After the caretakers themselves moved out in 1979, vandals broke every remaining pane of glass but one, and water damage rotted ceilings, floors, and portico. A portion of the east wall collapsed. In 1981 the Smith family sold the 32-acre parcel to Paducah Junior College, which planned to use the property in expanding the college. The college did not want to demolish the house, but it did not have the money to restore it either. Later that year, Kentucky governor John Y. Brown Jr. and Kentucky Secretary of Transportation Frank Metts decided that the house could serve as the I-24 welcome center. There was opposition from other tourism-dependent counties, which wanted a modern welcome center nearer the interstate highway and the Ohio River and believed that restoring the mansion benefited Paducah and McCracken County at the expense of other, nearby tourist areas. After a brief archaeological investigation, the house was carefully restored using as much original material as possible. The kitchen wing was partially demolished and the remainder adapted to serve as a welcome center, with restrooms, information desk, and storage areas. Three outbuildings\u2014the gazebo, storm shelter, and carriage house\u2014were also saved and repurposed. Part of the second floor of the house was devoted to displaying memorabilia of Kentucky politician and US vice president Alben Barkley (1877-1956). The welcome center, renamed \"Whitehaven,\" was officially opened on June 23, 1983.\n",

        "reference": " world's first nursing school to be continuously connected to a fully serving hospital and medical school (St. Thomas' Hospital). Established on 9 July 1860 by Florence Nightingale, the founder of modern nursing, it was a model for many similar training schools through the UK, Commonwealth and other countries for the latter half of the 19th century. It is primarily concerned with the education of people to become nurses and midwives. It also carries out nursing research, continuing professional development and postgraduate programmes. The Faculty forms part of the Waterloo campus on the South Bank of the River Thames and is now one of the largest faculties in the university. The school is ranked as the number one faculty for nursing in London and in the United Kingdom whilst third in the world rankings and belongs to one of the leading universities in health services, policy and research in the world. A freedom-of-information request in 2015 disclosed that the Florence Nightingale Faculty of Nursing and Midwifery had one of the lowest admission offer rates of 14% to its applicants. The faculty specialises in the following areas: child and adolescent nursing; midwifery and women's health; adult nursing; mental health nursing; and postgraduate research, with programmes catering to the needs of a wider range of individuals and healthcare professionals continuing their professional development. Inspired by Florence Nightingale and her nurses' work during the Crimean War, a fund was set up in 1855 by members of the public to raise money for her work. By June 1856, \u00a344,039 (equivalent to over \u00a34. 26\u00a0million in 2016) was raised. Nightingale decided to use the money to set up a training school at St Thomas' Hospital. The first nurses began their training on 9 July 1860. Graduates of the school used to be called 'Nightingales'. When Nightingale's school for nurses was initially set up, under the direction of Mrs Wardroper, the hospital matron, the students had a typical training period lasting a year. Students normally lived in-house; whilst having their own private rooms, a common room for lounge or socials was provided in the hospital's special area. The students attended their classes/patients at St. Thomas' Hospital. Around twenty to thirty students were accepted in a year, whose probationary period fall under two classifications. A common class woman who serves as student, upon completion, would receive a certain small amount of money plus a placement in a home or institution. An upper-class woman or 'Lady', on the other hand, would have completed some education and would be given the opportunity to assist in the school. Uniforms were provided at any case, and they would be under the charge of a matron (and an assistant). Upon graduation, they would be given a chance to visit Florence Nightingale in her South Street apartment, a momentous occasion for few people to meet her in person, especially since Nightingale's profile has been made well-known nationwide after the Crimean War. Nightingale kept extensive notes on all the students in the school, including their 'character'. She has placed certain importance to character; should there be any issue about one's character, the 'certification' of such nurse would be opposed to. Between 1860 and 1903 the school certified 1,907 nurses as having had one year's training. Many of the trainees went on to be matrons or superintendents of nursing. Over the years, the training and the school itself went through a series of changes, mergers and expansions. The curriculum for nurses has changed enormously since. Further, in 1991, the school merged with Olive Haydon School of Midwifery and the Thomas Guy & Lewisham School of Nursing, creating the Nightingale and Guy's College of Nursing & Midwifery. The following year the name changed to the Nightingale College of Health. In 1993, it merged with King's College Hospital School of Nursing at Normanby College and formed the Nightingale Institute. In 1996, the Institute was fully integrated into King's College London and was combined with the university's Department of Nursing Studies two years later to form the Florence Nightingale Division of Nursing & Midwifery. In 1999 it was renamed the Florence Nightingale School of Nursing and Midwifery. In September 2014 the school changed its name to the \"Florence Nightingale Faculty of Nursing and Midwifery\". In 2017 the Cicely Saunders Institute at King's moved from the Faculty of Life Sciences & Medicine to join with the Faculty of Nursing & Midwifery. The Faculty was renamed the Florence Nightingale Faculty of Nursing, Midwifery & Palliative Care.

White Abbey is part of the civil parish of Carnmoney and the historic barony of Belfast Lower. White Abbey's name is derived from a Catholic Premonstratensian abbey which existed in the area in the Medieval period, the canons of the order wear white habits. All traces of the abbey are now gone although the site, in a field beside the grounds of Whiteabbey Hospital at Doagh Road, remains undeveloped. It can be viewed from the adjacent Abbots Cross Garden Village. The site of the Premonstratensian Abbey is designated as a Scheduled Historic Monument at grid ref: J3497 8198. In the first half of the 19th century, the village of Whiteabbey was home to a large bleach works and was an important landing site for coal shipments bound for Belfast. Remnants of the old pier can still be seen in Belfast Lough. The importance of Whiteabbey declined after the channel into Belfast Harbour was widened and straightened, allowing larger ships to reach the city directly. Abbeylands, a two storey Victorian house in Whiteabbey, owned by Sir Hugh McCalmont, was set on fire by Suffragettes in 1914  causing \u00a320,000 of damage. Unionist leader, Edward Carson, had declared against votes for women, meanwhile his Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) had been drilling troops at Abbeylands House. In protest the Suffragettes burnt the building to the ground on 27 March 1914, complaining that they were being imprisoned while the UVF were gun running and preparing for civil war. In 1952, one of Northern Ireland's most controversial murders took place in Whiteabbey when Patricia Curran, the 19-year-old daughter of prominent Judge Ulster Unionist politician Sir Lancelot Curran, was found stabbed near her home, Glen House. Whiteabbey, together with Whitewell, Whitehouse, Jordanstown, Monkstown, Carnmoney and Glengormley, were the seven villages that formed Newtownabbey when it gained district council status on 1 April 1958. Near Whiteabbey one can find a popular dog-walking route known as 'the Glen', which is a small forest area extending up to and beyond the Bleach Green railway viaducts. The Newtownabbey/Ulster Way passes through this area, as does the Threemilewater river. Whiteabbey Hospital is located near the village. Whiteabbey is close to the main shopping area of Newtownabbey, containing the Abbeycentre, Abbey Business Park, Abbey Retail Park, Longwood Retail Park and Valley Retail Park. Whiteabbey also has its own train station allowing easy access to Belfast. Whiteabbey Primary School - Whiteabbey Primary School has a long tradition of child centred learning. The original school opened in the grounds of Whiteabbey Presbyterian Church in 1863,  moving to its present site on the Old Manse Road in 1939. There are currently 420 children in attendance at the school. The area is served by Whiteabbey railway station on the Belfast to Larne line. The station opened in April 1848. Although it lies outside Belfast, the area is also served by the Translink Metro service.\n",

These tunes formed the basis for two compositions by Edvard Grieg, included in his opus 72, Sl\u00e5tter. H\u00e5vard Gib\u00f8en came from a gifted family, and his father, Knut Gib\u00f8en, also played the fiddle. His mother, \u00c5sne, was related to the Berge family at Rauland, to whom many other folk musicians were connected. Like his contemporary Myllarguten, he was taught by the known fiddler Knut Lur\u00e5s from Tinn. H\u00e5vard was of small stature, and played in weddings and at feasts from early on. In his early years, he was so tiny he had to sit on a barrel, placed on a table, to be seen and heard. Unlike Myllarguten, he never left his home area, and hardly travelled farther than Kongsberg. He lived his whole life on his mountain farm, and eventually died there in 1873. His son, Kjetil, and his grandsons after him, were fiddlers in the same tradition - carried on to this very day. As Myllarguten was known for his improvisations and reshaping of tradition, H\u00e5vard was \"traditional\", and kept his fiddle tunes unchanged. Thus, he became a valuable source for an older tradition. H\u00e5vard was reckoned to be introvert, and preferred more melancholic tunes. His tonality, which was passed on after him, was old-fashioned, even \"medieval\" to some extent. His musical style were preserved, not only by his sons, but also by the fiddler Knut Dahle and his grandsons in Tinn. In Telemark, it is common knowledge that the tradition of H\u00e5vard survived in the eastern parts, Tinn and Tuddal, while the tradition of Myllarguten was preserved in the west: Rauland and Vinje.

It was named after Joseph Trumpeldor, who was killed at Tel Hai by Arabs, and was joined by many of Trumpeldor's followers who had made aliyah from Crimea; initial membership was around 80. The group drained swamps, paved roads, worked in agriculture and construction, establishing several kibbutzim, including Ein Harod (22 September 1921), Kfar Giladi, Ramat Rachel and Tel Yosef (14 December 1921). Many former members left to join the Solel Boneh construction company after learning their trade in the battalion. In 1923 the battalion split on ideological grounds; the left-wing demanded socialism, whilst the right-wing were more interested in Zionist pioneering. Despite the split, by 1925 the group had over 650 members, including Israel Shochat, Manya Shochat and Yitzhak Sadeh. In December 1926 a communist faction of the battalion was expelled. Some members of the faction returned to Russia, where they formed a commune named Vojo Nova (Esperanto for  \"A New Way\"), which was later liquidated during the Stalinist purges. The following year Gdud HaAvoda stopped work, and in 1929 it was dissolved after Kfar Giladi, Ramat Rachel, Tel Hai and Tel Yosef formed the HaKibbutz HaMeuhad movement.\n",

In the World Indoor Championships at Seville in 1991, Tanui crossed the line first, but was disqualified for breaking from his lane too early. He won 800 metres in the 1991 All-Africa Games. Tanui's greatest moment came at the 1992 Olympic Games in Barcelona. In the 800 m final he stormed down the outside, actually finishing in lane 3, to narrowly beat a fellow countryman Nixon Kiprotich for the gold medal. Tanui was unable to repeat this form in his only appearance at a World Championships, at Stuttgart in 1993, finishing seventh. He finished 2nd at the IAAF World Cup 800 metres race in 1992 and 1994. Tanui concentrated more on the 1500 m in the latter part of his career, and he finished fifth at that distance in the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta.

The dominant feature of the municipality is the parish Church of St. Sebestian built in 1730-1733 when, in 1780, the church was enlarged with the church tower. The remains of an unknown saint that were brought here in the basket carried on the back from Rome by the hermit Severin are placed here. The railway connection to Osoblaha was formerly planned to be the standard gauge railway with starting point in the town of M\u011bsto Albrechtice and continue towards Slezsk\u00e9 Rudoltice. To save costs, the starting point of the railway was set to be in T\u0159eme\u0161n\u00e1 and, more importantly, the narrow-gauge system (i.e. 760\u00a0mm) was used. Construction works of the Osoblaha narrow-gauge railway began in 1898, with the first train departed on the 14 December the same year. The narrow-gauge train departs from the opposite side of the railway station than standard-gauge trains to Krnov-Jind\u0159ichov ve Slezsku. The route starts with the downhill gradient of 26\u2030 to a steel bridge in T\u0159eme\u0161n\u00e1. The route then ascends the highest gradient of 27\u2030 and shortly before Lipta\u0148 municipality follows the radius of only 75 metres. Just after the Koberno train stop the route enters the romantic, woody countryside of the river Osoblaha and around the ruins of Ful\u0161tejn castle continues to its final stop on the edge of Osoblaha just on the Czech-Polish border crossing. In 2003, the First Narrow-gauge Railway Association was created supporting the new narrow-gauge railway era. The association aims to support the tourism development in Osobla\u017esko region by the steam transport development on the narrow-gauge railway. The Polish city of G\u0142ucho\u0142azy is accessible from T\u0159eme\u0161n\u00e1 by train.

        "reference": " Aisle) on the south side of St Andrew's Church, Cullompton. Due to a misreading of the inscription on the exterior of his Chapel he was said by Polwhele (1793) to have occupied the office of Wapentake Custos, Lanarius, (translated as \"Constable of the Hundred, wool merchant\"). However no historical evidence supports the existence of such an office and the inscription was later correctly re-interpreted by Smirke (1847). The Lane Chapel is a grand structure of five bays with large windows and a magnificent fan-vaulted ceiling. Building work commenced in 1526 (as is stated on the lengthy inscription on the external walls), two years before Lane's death, was continued by his widow Thomasine and finished in 1552, according to an inscription on the exterior of the east wall. It is profusely embellished in the interior on the ceiling corbels and bosses with relief sculptures of angels holding Lane's merchant's mark. The exterior walls are embellished with relief sculptures (now severely worn away by the elements) of biblical scenes and of items related to Lane and his trade, such as ships, cloth shears, teasel frames, merchant's marks, monograms, etc. A lengthy relief-sculpted inscription in English in black-letter Gothic script runs around the three exterior walls of the building, low-down beneath the windows (see below). The Lane Chapel is comparable in many respects to the nearby Greenway Chapel and Greenway Porch in St Peter's Church, Tiverton, built in 1517 by his contemporary fellow merchant John Greenway (died 1529). At the east end of the opposite (north) aisle of Cullompton Church is situated the Moor Hayes Chapel, anciently the property of the Moore family of Moor Hayes, within the parish, lords of the manor of Cullompton. \"Plaintiff: Thomasyne late wife of John Lane, of Cullompton; Defendant: Humphrey More, John More, Christopher More, and John Smyth. Place or subject: Forcible entry into a chapel built by plaintiff's late husband adjoining to the parish church\".

        "prefix": "The Fischer oxazole synthesis is a chemical synthesis of an oxazole from a cyanohydrin and an aldehyde in the presence of anhydrous",
        "reference": " hydrochloric acid. This method was discovered by Emil Fischer in 1896. The cyanohydrin itself is derived from a separate aldehyde. The reactants of the oxazole synthesis itself, the cyanohydrin of an aldehyde and the other aldehyde itself, are usually present in equimolar amounts. Both reactants usually have an aromatic group, which appear at specific positions on the resulting heterocycle. A more specific example of Fischer oxazole synthesis involves reacting mandelic acid nitrile with benzaldehyde to give 2,5-diphenyl-oxazole. Fischer developed the Fischer oxazole synthesis during his time at Berlin University. The Fischer oxazole synthesis was one of the first syntheses developed to produce 2,5-disubstituted oxazoles. The Fischer oxazole synthesis is a type of dehydration reaction which can occur under mild conditions in a rearrangement of the groups that would not seem possible. The reaction occurs by dissolving the reactants in dry ether and passing through the solution dry, gaseous hydrogen chloride. The product, which is the 2,5-disubstituted oxazole, precipitates as the hydrochloride and can be converted to the free base by the addition of water or by boiling with alcohol. The cyanohydrins and aldehydes used for the synthesis are usually aromatic, however there have been instances where aliphatic compounds have been used. The first step of the mechanism is the addition of gaseous HCl to the cyanohydrin 1. The cyanohydrin abstracts the hydrogen from HCl while the chloride ion attacks the carbon in the cyano group. This first step results in the  formation of an iminochloride intermediate 2, probably as the hydrochloride salt. This intermediate then reacts with the aldehyde; the  hydroxyl group of 2 abstracts a hydrogen from the nitrogen, while the lone pair of the nitrogen attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon on the aldehyde. The following step results in an SN2 attack  followed by the loss water to give a chloro-oxazoline intermediate 4. Next is the tautomerization of the a ring proton. The last step involves an elimination and the loss of an HCl molecule to form the product 6, which is the 2,5-diaryloxazole. Diarylazoles are common structural motifs in both natural products and drug candidates, however they are difficult to synthesize. Diaryloxazoles are generally prepared through the Fischer oxazole synthesis or Robinson-Gabriel synthesis, where the oxazole ring is constructed via either synthesis. The Fischer oxazole synthesis has also been useful in the synthesis of 2-(4-Bromophenyl)5-phenyloxazole starting with benzaldehyde cyanohydrin and 4-bromobenzaldehyde. However, oxazole ring chlorination occurs to give 2,5-bis(4-bromophenyl)-4-chlorooxazole 7 along with 2,5-bis(4-bromophenyl)-4-oxazolidinone 8. The latter compound is in general a by-product. Another useful example is the one pot two-step synthesis of halfordinol, a parent compound for Rutaceae alkaloids. The initial steps follow the Fischer oxazole synthesis, although the acid-catalyzed cyclization occurs in two steps rather than one, which ensures the formation of the di-chloro intermediate, preventing formation of the  regioisomer. In recent research, a reconsideration of the Fischer oxazole synthesis has led to the synthesis of 2,5-disubstituted oxazoles from aldehydes and \u03b1-hydroxy-amides. However, unlike the Fischer oxazole synthesis, the new method is not limited to diaryloxazoles.\n",

        "prefix": "Fear Before (formerly known as Fear Before the March of Flames) is an experimental rock  band that resides in Aurora, Colorado. As stated on their Alternative Press",
        "reference": " podcast, their name originates from a Denver Post newspaper headline about the 2002 Hayman fire titled \"The Fear Before The March of Flames\". They released their debut album Odd How People Shake in 2003 with a re-release in January 2004, second album Art Damage in September 2004, third album The Always Open Mouth in September 2006, and fourth album Fear Before in October 2008. In 2010 the band announced they were going into an indefinite hiatus. In 2002, Fear Before the March of Flames was formed in Aurora, Colorado with vocalist David Marion, guitarist/vocalist Adam Fisher, bassist Michael Madruga, and drummer Brandon Proff. The original members all met at Smoky Hill High School in Aurora. However, Adam is the only Colorado native. The band took their name from a local newspaper headline when wildfires swept through their state. The band drew inspiration from bands such as Botch, Converge and The Blood Brothers in creating their music. Prior to forming Fear Before, Adam, Mike, and Brandon were in a pop-punk band together called thirtysixflip. David was their merchandise guy. After they decided to pursue a more abrasive post-hardcore/mathcore direction, David joined, and Fear Before the March of Flames was born. The band played their first show on August 1, 2002. In July and October 2002, the band recorded their three-song debut EP with Jason Anderson at Grey Music Recording Company in Thornton, Colorado. The band sold copies of this EP on their early tours, which garnered the attention of Portland based Rise Records. Once signed to Rise, the band released their debut album Odd How People Shake in July 2003. They gained notoriety outside of Colorado from tours with bands such as The Blood Brothers and Hopesfall. However, it was on the tour with the band Bear vs. Shark when they were noticed and then signed to the more prominent Equal Vision Records, who re-released their debut in January 2004. Their debut was primarily in the vein of post-hardcore, featuring a mix of screamed vocals on the part of David Michael Marion and clean singing provided by Adam Rupert Fisher. It is rumoured that every song on the album is based on a movie (\"Sarah Goldfarb, Where are Your Manners\"?, for example, is about Requiem for a Dream). In concert, the band plays few, if any, songs from their debut. On their website, they explicitly state that they will not play one song in particular from their debut, \"On the Brightside, She Could Choke;\". However, on October 30, 2007 at a show in Houston, Texas, they played an acoustic set at Warehouse Live that included \"On the Brightside\". Due to a loss in drummer Clayton Holyoak's family, the band decided to play an acoustic set because they were at a loss of percussion. On September 5, 2008 at an intimate hometown show in Denver, during their encore, Fear Before asked the audience what song they wanted to hear. Unanimously, the entire audience started to chant for \"Brightside\". After some hesitation, the band played the song in its original form for the first time since 2003. The band has also played this song twice since this show, once in Anaheim, California, and again in Denver. From late July 2004 to mid-August 2004, the band played with Evergreen Terrace and I Killed the Prom Queen on the Radiotakeover Tour. The band also played select dates with Norma Jean in August and October as well. In August, the band recorded a live EP at The Epicentre in San Diego, California, titled Live at the Epicentre, which was released in September. Their second album, Art Damage, was released on Equal Vision Records in September 2004, and was a marked change in direction for the band. Art Damage featured \"a much more straightforward, significantly harder style\". Different from the earlier material, FBTMOF changed from the original indie post-hardcore sound to more of a mathcore based sound. The video for the single \"Should Have Stayed in the Shallows\" was filmed in the same basement as the one used in the film Fight Club and was heavily rotated on MTV2's show Headbanger's Ball. Through April 2005, the band toured with Underoath and The Chariot. The band also played on the Sounds of the Underground tour on Midwest and Southeast dates. On October 18, 2005, Immortal Records released the soundtrack for the Masters of Horror television series. Fear Before the March of Flames provided a previously unreleased song, \"237\", for the soundtrack. The song took its name from the infamous room number from the film The Shining. It was featured in the credits for the Tobe Hooper-directed episode Dance of the Dead. In June 2006, the band played at the 7 Angels 7 Plagues Reunion Show, and in August they played at the Dirt Fest. Their third studio album, The Always Open Mouth, was released on September 19, 2006. Fischer explains that the title of the album refers to people who act like \"An all-knowing super being from another realm sent here to save us all, or be a fucking loud mouth bigot. They are The Always Open Mouth\". This album marks a considerably different sound from previous recordings, containing a much more experimental side with more emphasis on antiphony between the lead vocalist Marion, and guitarist/vocalist Fisher, and a considerably lesser amount of screaming. It is described as \"boldly experimental and brimming with musical complexity\". The band has replied to fan response that found the album to be a large departure from the sound of Art Damage by stating that they \"just wanted to do something we hadn't done before\". MTV featured a commercial for the album, showing internet character Daniel P. Walters (aka \"The Tourettes Guy\"), who cursed and complained about the volume. The first single from the album was the song \"Taking Cassandra to the End of the World Party\", and a video was also filmed with director David Bell. The song references the Greek legend of Cassandra, a woman who possessed the gift of prophecy, but was cursed by the fact that no one would believe her tellings. Proff left the band to pursue a teaching career and drummer Clayton \"Goose\" Holyoak, guitarist Zach \"Binks\" Hutchings, and guitarist/keyboardist Billy Johnson were added. From October 2006 to December 2006, the band played with previous tour-mates Norma Jean, and Between the Buried and Me, on the first ever Radio Rebellion Tour. In March 2007, the band played a portion of the Russian Circles Plan Midwest Tour and played one day at the Appalachian Annihilation Festival. That month the band again changed their lineup. They stated that Billy Johnson (touring guitarist) left the band due to personal reasons. In July/August 2007 the band embarked on their first headlining tour with 65daysofstatic, This Will Destroy You, and Hot Cross as support. For this tour they released a limited edition EP entitled A Little Less Teeth, featuring live sessions, outtakes, and demos. The band had planned to release a DVD titled Absolute Past, Absolute Future with an estimated release date of Spring 2007. The DVD would cover the band's touring before they recorded The Always Open Mouth and the two months spent in Seattle recording the album. Fear Before the March of Flames explained that the DVD will not be \"random live footage from four years [. ] followed by random live footage from three years ago\". Absolute Past, Absolute Future would be presented in documentary form, telling the history of the band chronologically. However, the footage was lost and the release was scrapped. In the January 2008 issue of Alternative Press, the band was featured as having one of the most anticipated albums of the year. The album, titled Fear Before, was recorded in Seattle, WA at Johnny Cab Studios with producer Casey Bates (Gatsbys American Dream, Portugal. The Man, The Fall of Troy) during June and July 2008 and was released October 28, 2008. The self-titled album marked many changes for the band. This is the first album on which lead vocalist Dave Marion contributed the majority of lyrics. In the past, guitarist and back-up vocalist Adam Fisher had written the majority of the lyrics. In contrast to their previous work, most of Dave's vocals on this album are sung as opposed to screamed. This is the first album to feature current drummer Clayton 'Goose' Holyoak, as well as the first and last album where Zachary 'Binks' Hutchings had a substantial role in the writing of a Fear Before album. He had previously played on The Always Open Mouth but did not contribute to writing. The album features guest vocals by a number of people,  most notably Thomas Erak from The Fall Of Troy as well as Zachary Carothers of Portugal. The Man, Robert Smith of Heavy Heavy Low Low, Quentin Smith of Vaux, and Dreu Damian of I Am The Ocean. One of the songs from the album, \"Review Our Lives\", is a revised version of \"Epic Song\", which was previously released as a live session on their A Little Less Teeth EP. In September 2008 they embarked on a headlining tour with Damiera and I Am the Ocean as support. Fear Before also announced on September 9, 2008 that they would be dropping \"The March of Flames\" from their name, and would from now on be known as simply \"Fear Before\". The band had considered keeping their full name and simply titling the album Fear Before, but decided against it at the last minute. In early 2009, Zach Hutchings left the band to join Utah group I Am the Ocean. Adam has stated that Zach left due to some personal and creative tensions, though Zach and the band remain good friends. The band decided to remain a four piece. After Binks' departure, the band supported Alesana on a package tour that spring. In the summer, Fear Before toured Australia for the first time, where their friend Trent Jacobi fell through the roof of a house and was hospitalized. In response to this event, Fear Before posted their discography on Bandcamp.com to raise money to cover hospital bills. Tour and labelmates Circa Survive also released a limited edition 7\" featuring b-sides from On Letting Go to raise money for Trent. After returning from Australia they embarked on what would be their last headlining tour, with Oceana and Memphis May Fire as support. The band planned to not tour in 2010 and instead stay home and continue work on their fifth full-length. The band's last show before their hiatus began was on December 4, 2009 at the Crabtree Brewing Company in Greeley, Colorado. In January 2011, Adam played his first solo show at the Larimer Lounge in Denver, Colorado. He revealed that the songs he had been writing were not quite right for Fear Before, and later dubbed the project All Human. After playing several local shows in the Denver and Salt Lake areas, he released the first All Human demos online. A 14-track album tentatively titled Catholic Guilt and the Queerest of Thoughts was expected to be released later in the  year, and is notable for featuring original Fear Before drummer Brandon Proff on many of the tracks. After close to 18 months of silence from the band, Adam posted the following message on the band's Facebook, signaling an indefinite hiatus. \"guys. im sorry if you have been left with the feeling that we (fear before the march of flames) have been leading you on making you think were working on music. we are not. as of april 2010 goose david mike and i have not been in the same room together with our instruments. however, until april 2010 i had written quite a few songs for a new fear before the march of flames record with the help of goose. whether or not we will ever release another record is up in the air right now. there is no immediate plan to write/record/ or tour. this has nothing to do with Orbs, Loom, All Human, or any other project goose or i may be a part of. Its just the way things went. 2009 took a very weird turn for us and it kinda left all of us collectively and individually wondering what the hell we were doing. I truly am sorry to everyone who is anxiously awaiting a new record from us. im not saying it will never happen, i just cant say that it will. we appreciate all you as friends and fans have allowed us to do and the second there is any development in fear before world you will be the first to know. please feel free to voice your opinion on the matter and i will respond. just know i truly hate bumming any of you out. it truly wasn't my or our intent for it to come to this. as far as all human goes, that is where i will be directing my creative energy for the time being. i hope you guys will enjoy that for what it is. its not a side project or something to keep me busy until something else comes along. it is the music i feel like making and sharing for right now. love you guys. thank you for your support. Three days later he made another statement making it clear the band was not breaking up, saying \"friends. do not mistake my previous post for a break up announcement. it was an update letting you know that we are currently inactive and there is no forthcoming record from us as of now. i cannot say what the future holds. As of October 20, 2014 the band had alluded on their Facebook to new upcoming material, saying \"New songs. No hoax\". The band has since updated their Facebook to reflect new material titled \"Absolute Future Absolute Past\". This DVD footage was lost; Adam told the story in the AP Podcast, available on iTunes.

Although the Negro American League would last until 1960, 1951 was, notably, the last season in which the Negro American League was considered major-league caliber, which was itself the last major Negro league baseball organization. January 23 \u2013 Guido Rugo sells his interest in the Boston Braves to copartners Lou Perini and treasurer Joe Maney. January 26 \u2013 The baseball writers vote Mel Ott and Jimmie Foxx into the Hall Of Fame. March 10 \u2013 The St. Louis Browns reveal plans to move the club to Milwaukee because of poor attendance. February 5 \u2013  California governor Earl Warren rejects the rumor that he is a candidate for the MLB Commissioner position. March 12 \u2013 Baseball commissioner Happy Chandler loses his bid to remain in office. Chandler, who started his term as commissioner in 1945, is voted down, 9\u20137, in a tally of owners. He will be succeeded by Ford C. Frick. March 21 \u2013 During spring training, Pittsburgh Pirates lefty first baseman Dale Long makes his first appearance as a catcher in an exhibition game at San Diego, California, after Pirates general manager Branch Rickey decided to flaunt tradition and try him as a catcher for the foreseeable future. Pretty soon, Long joined the St. Louis Browns on waivers and went back to first base. Eventually, he would catch two games in 1958 with the Chicago Cubs, using a first baseman's mitt. April 17 \u2013 At Shibe Park, the Philadelphia Athletics and the Washington Senators play the first Opening Day night game in American League history. The Senators prevailed, 6\u20131, behind the solid pitching of Cuban 40-year-old Connie Marrero, as his batterymate Mickey Grasso hits a three-run home run. Marrero pitches nine strong innings, allowing one earned run on seven hits and two walks while striking out six batters. Bobby Shantz is the losing pitcher. May 1 \u2013 On Mother's Day, New York Yankees rookie Mickey Mantle hit the first home run of his career off Randy Gumpert in an 8\u20133 victory over the Chicago White Sox at Comiskey Park. In the same game, Cuban third baseman and former Negro Leagues star Minnie Mi\u00f1oso becomes the first black player in White Sox franchise history. In his first Major League at-bat, Mi\u00f1oso hit a home run while facing Yankees starter Vic Raschi. May 2 \u2013 At Briggs Stadium, Philadelphia Athletics pinch hitter Lou Limmer stepped into the batters box to face Detroit Tigers pitcher Saul Rogovin. The 6'2\" right-hander peered in to get the signal from catcher Joe Ginsberg, nodded assent, and went into the windup. Around came the arm, in came the pitch and Limmer swung, sending a drive to deep right that cleared the fence for a home run. After all, pinch hit home runs are not unique, but what is unique is that the pitcher, the catcher, and the hitter were all Jewish. It is the only known time in Major League Baseball that has occurred. May 6 \u2013 In the second game of a doubleheader, Cliff Chambers pitches a no-hitter, as the Pittsburgh Pirates top the Boston Braves, 3\u20130. June 4 \u2013 Gus Bell hits for the cycle, droves in three runs and scores two more, to lead the Pittsburgh Pirates to a 12\u20134 victory over the Philadelphia Phillies at Connie Mack Stadium. July 1 \u2013 In the first game of a doubleheader, Bob Feller tosses the third no-hitter of his career for the Cleveland Indians in a 2\u20131 win over the Detroit Tigers. July 10 \u2013 Exploding for a record four home runs, the National League trounces the American League, 8\u20133, at the annual All-Star Game, at Briggs Stadium in Detroit. Pittsburgh Pirates' slugger Ralph Kiner hits a home run for the 3rd year in a row. July 12 \u2013 New York Yankees hurler Allie Reynolds pitches a no-hitter against the Cleveland Indians in a 1\u20130 win. July 17 \u2013 After pitching for Bill Veeck in Cleveland in 1948, Satchel Paige rejoins him with the St. Louis Browns. July 28 \u2013 Clyde Vollmer, who started the month on the bench, continues his explosive fireworks against the Indians. Vollmer singles in the tying run in the 15th inning and then in the 16th hits a grand slam off reliever Bob Feller for an 8\u20134 Red Sox win. The grand slam is the latest hit in a game in major-league history. Mickey McDermott pitches all 16 innings for the Sox, striking out 15 and walking one. August 11 \u2013 Robin Roberts of the Philadelphia Phillies beat the New York Giants, 4\u20130, dropping the Giants 13. 5 games behind the first-place Brooklyn Dodgers. August 19 \u2013 Bill Veeck, the showman and maverick owner of the St. Louis Browns, pulls off one of the greatest stunts in baseball history. In the second game of a doubleheader against the Detroit Tigers, Veeck sends Eddie Gaedel to the plate as a pinch-hitter for leadoff batter Frank Saucier. At  tall, Gaedel became the shortest player in baseball history. Due to his extremely small strike zone, Gaedel walked on four consecutive pitches and was immediately pulled for a pinch-runner. American League president Will Harridge, saying Veeck was making a mockery of the game, voided Gaedel's contract the next day. Detroit went on to win the game, 6\u20132. September 1 \u2013 New York Giants outfielder Don Mueller hit three home runs and drove in five runs in an 8\u20131 victory over the Brooklyn Dodgers at Polo Grounds. Sal Maglie was the winning pitcher. Dodgers starter Ralph Branca\u201a coming off two consecutive shutouts\u201a lasted only four innings. The only run for Brooklyn came on a hit by pitch, when Maglie hit Jackie Robinson with the bases loaded in the third inning. Besides, Whitey Lockman was plunked twice by Dodgers relievers Bud Podbielan and Phil Haugstad. In a flashy fielding play, shortstop Alvin Dark and second baseman Eddie Stanky combined in the fifth inning on a triple play off a liner by Dodgers shortstop Pee Wee Reese. September 14 \u2013 Bob Nieman of the St. Louis Browns became the first player in Major League history to hit two home runs in his debut. Nieman will be joined by Bert Campaneris (1964) and Mark Quinn (1999) in the select group. September 28 \u2013 Allie Reynolds turns in the second no-hitter of his career, and his second this season, as the New York Yankees blank the Boston Red Sox, 8\u20130. October 3 \u2013 The New York Giants had been thirteen and one-half games behind the National League leading Brooklyn Dodgers in August, but under Leo Durocher's guidance and with the aid of a sixteen-game winning streak, caught the Dodgers to tie for the lead with two days left in the season. As both teams won their last two games, they ended up tied. The two teams play a best-of three playoff. In Game 3 with one out in the ninth inning and runners on second and third, the Giants were down 4\u20132 to the Dodgers when Bobby Thomson hit a home run to win the game 5\u20134. The \"Shot heard 'round the world\" clinched the National League pennant for the Giants, and WMCA-AM radio announcer Russ Hodges' frantic \"The Giants win the pennant\"!, said four times consecutively, is one of the most famous home run calls in baseball history. October 10 \u2013 The New York Yankees defeat the New York Giants, 4\u20133, in Game 6 of the World Series to win their third consecutive World Championship, and fourteenth overall. Just before the game, Giants manager Leo Durocher turns over a letter he received to Ford Frick that offered the Giants manager a $15,000 bribe \"if the Giants managed to lose the next 3 games\". October 17 \u2013 The Yomiuri Giants win the Japan Series over the Nankai Hawks. The Giants went on to win the Central League pennant 19 times in the next 23 years, including nine in succession (1965\u201373). November 1 \u2013 Brooklyn Dodgers catcher Roy Campanella was named National League Most Valuable Player, the first of three awards he would receive during his Hall of Fame career. During the season, Campanella hit a. 325 batting average with 33 home runs and 108 run batted in. November 10 \u2013 In Tokyo, Japan 50,000 fans are on hand as an American All-Star team battles a Central League All-Star team. Joe DiMaggio hits a 400-foot home run in the eighth inning to tie the game at 1\u20131, then his younger brother Dom laces an RBI-triple in the ninth and later scores to give the Americans a 3\u20132 victory. The Americans have won 12 games and tied one. November 23 \u2013 The New York Yankees send young catcher Clint Courtney to the St. Louis Browns in exchange for pitcher Jim McDonald. Courtney, regarded as the first major league catcher to wear eyeglasses, had appeared in one game for New York. November 27 \u2013 In an eight-player trade, the St. Louis Browns send C Sherm Lollar, P Al Widmar and IF Tom Upton to the Chicago White Sox in exchange for C Gus Niarhos, P Dick Littlefield, 1B Gordon Goldsberry, SS Joe DeMaestri and OF Jim Rivera. Rivera, a favorite of Browns manager Rogers Hornsby, will return to the Sox in eight months. November 28 \u2013 The St. Louis Browns trade Niarhos, along with OF Ken Wood to the Boston Red Sox for C Les Moss and OF Tom Wright. The Browns also sign Marty Marion, former St. Louis Cardinals shortstop/manager. December 11 \u2013 Three-time MVP and 13-time All Star center fielder Joe DiMaggio officially retired as a member of the New York Yankees. In a 13-season career for the club, DiMaggio posted a. 325 batting average with 361 home runs and 1,537 runs batted in in 1,736 games played. A future Hall of Famer, his 56-game consecutive-game hitting streak in the 1941 season is the longest in Major League Baseball history and will stand as one of the all-time best diamond achievements.

Halicki moved from New York to California and worked on vehicles, eventually owning his own impound and towing business. H.B. Halicki Mercantile Co. & Junk Yard was known for its extensive antique automobile and toy collections. Halicki wrote, directed, produced, and starred in the film Gone in 60 Seconds in 1974. There was no official script for the movie, apart from several pages outlining main dialog sequences. Halicki supplied most of the cars and used repeated footage of the same vehicles and shots of public incidents to increase the footage. The scene in which a train derailment is observed was not part of the original shooting script; it is in fact a real train that derailed. When the director heard about the wreck, he wanted to incorporate it into the film. Halicki compacted 10 vertebrae performing the film's  jump finale and walked with a limp afterwards. Halicki married Denice Shakarian in 1989, shortly before he began filming his 1989 sequel, Gone in 60 Seconds 2, in which both of them would star. Halicki bought over 400 automobiles to destroy in the film, which was to feature improved car chases and storyline. On August 20, 1989, while filming in Dunkirk and Buffalo, New York, Toby was preparing for the most dramatic stunt sequence in the film, during which a  water tower was supposed to topple to the ground. When a cable attached to the tower snapped unexpectedly, it sheared off a telephone pole, which fell on Halicki, killing him instantly. The accident occurred in an area behind the former J.H. Williams Tool factory at 400 Vulcan Street in Buffalo. In 1995, Denice Shakarian Halicki began work with Jerry Bruckheimer and Touchstone Pictures to produce a 2000 remake of the original 1974 film. The remake included the Fastback Mustang \"Eleanor\". In its opening weekend, the remake grossed $25,336,048 from 3,006 US theaters, leading all films that weekend. By the end of the film's theatrical run, it had grossed $101,648,571 domestically and $135,553,728 internationally, comprising a total gross revenue for the film of $237,202,299 worldwide. The popularity of the 2000 remake resulted in illegal copies of the custom Eleanor car being produced. Denice Halicki successfully sued to stop trademark and copyright infringement.\n",

The book is narrated by Thurstan Beauchamp, a young man of English-Norman origins and describes Sicilian life through his eyes. All the good elements of a novel are contained in it: mystery, love, passion, betrayal, and revenge, but the novel's description of life in 12th century Sicily and its resonance to our own times that makes the novel especially interesting. Writing in the Guardian, John Julius Norwich said that the novel made him feel what it felt like to live, work and travel in the Sicily of that time. Jason Goodwin in The New York Times Book Review points to the contemporary resonance of the story, set as it is in the brief time that Normans, Byzantines, Greeks, Muslims, and Jews lived together in relative harmony. The harmony did not work, says Goodwin and \"we  glimpse the fragile nature of the Sicilian compact \u2014 and the gloomy inevitability of the civil conflict that lies ahead\".\n",

Ochanine holds a master's degree in Conducting from the University of Southern California and pursued a Doctorate in Orchestral Conducting, at the Cincinnati College - Conservatory of Music, before taking up his post with the Philippine Philharmonic. Olivier Ochanine is the 1st Prize Winner of the 2015 Antal Dorati International Conducting Competition in Budapest, Hungary, in which he surpassed nearly 120 other conductors from 23 countries; the prize leads to further performances in Europe. In addition, he is winner of the prestigious The American Prize (2015) in the Professional Orchestra Conducting division. Olivier is also 2nd Prize Winner in the 2015 London Classical Soloists International Conducting Competition, where he conducted the orchestra in various Beethoven symphonies. Regularly praised for his charisma on and off podium as well as for his breadth of orchestral repertoire, Olivier was the youngest Music Director of the Philippine Philharmonic Orchestra in the orchestra's history. A native of Paris, Olivier Ochanine began music studies in France. He continued music studies in the United States, and expanded his focus to orchestral conducting, taking up graduate studies and attending master classes with some of the best conducting mentors, including Mark Gibson, Gustav Meier, Marin Alsop, Larry Livingston, Robert Baldwin, John Barnett, John Farrer, and Achim Holub. He obtained his master's degree in Conducting from the University of Southern California (USC), where he was given the Conducting Department Award in 2003. In 2009, he began his Doctoral Studies in Orchestral Conducting at the Cincinnati College-Conservatory of Music under Mark Gibson. A flutist and bassist, Olivier earned his bachelor's degree from the University of Kentucky. He has also played as bassist for the Lexington Philharmonic Orchestra. Olivier has been invited to the California Conductors Institute several times. In 2009, Mr. Ochanine was among a handful of conductors nationally to be invited by Baltimore Symphony Orchestra Music Director Marin Alsop to conduct in the Cabrillo Music Festival in Santa Cruz, California and to participate in a conducting workshop. He has also been a participant in the Cincinnati College-Conservatory's conducting workshops. Olivier's term with the Philippine Philharmonic Orchestra, the nation's leading orchestra, started with the 2010-2011 performance season. Under his leadership, the orchestra performed numerous Philippine premieres and made its first recording in over a decade. Ochanine has also been credited for greatly improving the level of the PPO's playing. In the Philippines, Olivier has been an active musician, leading masterclasses of chamber music at schools; he has also led conducting masterclasses for the Cultural Center of the Philippines. As part of his outreach mission, Olivier served for several years as head visiting conductor for the Orchestra of the Filipino Youth, a program geared toward talented youth that stem from severely unfortunate financial backgrounds. Olivier is a strong believer in advocacy and heritage, and recently won a campaign he spearheaded to save the best performance hall in Manila - the Philam Life Theater - from demolishment by a large commercial developer. In 2016, Olivier's project to bring the Philippine Philharmonic Orchestra to Carnegie Hall materialized after years of fundraising and planning, making this the first time a Filipino orchestra has performed in the famed venue. He is a regular guest conductor with the Vietnam National Symphony Orchestra and Sichuan Philharmonic Orchestra (China), and has also conducted the Cincinnati College-Conservatory Orchestras, Budapest MAV Symphony Orchestra, and George Enescu Philharmonic Orchestra, Moscow State Symphony Orchestra, and Gyor Philharmonic Orchestra, among others.\n",

This list focuses heavily on trains in the classical sense used for large-scale railways for passengers and freight but does include a few people mover systems. The first line to be operated with Automatic Train Operation (ATO) was London Underground's Victoria line, which opened in 1967, although a driver is present in the cabin. Many lines now operate using an ATO system, with the aim of improving the frequency of service. Since then, ATO technology has been developed to enable trains to operate even without a driver in a cab: either with an attendant roaming within the train, or with no staff on board. The first fully automated driverless mass-transit rail network is the Port Island Line in Kobe, Japan. The second in the world (and the first such driverless system in Europe) is the Lille Metro in northern France. The list is ordered in descending order of the degree of automation. It uses the Grade of Automation classifications specified by the standard IEC 62290\u20101. These are explained diagrammatically by the UITP. In this system, trains are capable of operating automatically at all times, including door closing, obstacle detection and emergency situations. On-board staff may be provided for other purposes, e.g. customer service, but are not required for safe operation. Examples include the Docklands Light Railway, the Barcelona Metro line 9, Sydney Metro, and the Copenhagen Metro. In this system, trains run automatically from station to station but a staff member is always in the train, with responsibility for handling of emergency situations. In a GoA3 system, the train cannot operate safely without the staff member on board. In this system, trains run automatically from station to station but a driver is in the cab, with responsibility for door closing, obstacle detection on the track in front of the train and handling of emergency situations. As in a GoA3 system, the GoA2 train cannot operate safely without the staff member on board. Examples include the London Underground Victoria line. These systems are capable of unattended train operation (UTO), although some operators may choose to staff trains anyway.\n",

He founded a settlement called Hannahville with his brothers, helped to set up the first school in the area, and chaired the first township meeting for Nelson Township in 1836. In 1828, he was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Upper Canada for Halton as a Reformer, and was considered radical enough to be endorsed by the Colonial Advocate. He did not run in 1830 but was reelected in 1834. Despite his radical views, he was not implicated in the 1837 Rebellion, thus enabling him to become one of the major Reform leaders. He was elected to the 1st Parliament of the Province of Canada in East Halton, and immediately associated with the \"ultra-Reform\" wing headed by Robert Baldwin; however, he soon gained a reputation for being a maverick within the party. In 1841, he supported the District Councils Act, which was opposed by the other Reformers. In stating his support, he declared, \"I came here to build up a countrynot a party. I shall vote for the bill\". In 1843, he sided with the Tories in opposing the move of the capital from Kingston to Montreal, and also expressed his disapproval when the Reform government resigned in protest over a dispute with the Governor, Charles Metcalfe. As a result, he was ostracized within the party, and later rejected for nomination in 1844 in favour of John Wetenhall. He decided to run as well, thus splitting the vote and allowing George Chalmers, the Conservative candidate, to win. Upon the rise of the Clear Grits, Hopkins joined them and became one of the revered \"old Reformers\". When Malcolm Cameron resigned from the Baldwin-Lafontaine government to join them, he was replaced in the Cabinet by Wetenhall, who was obliged to run in a mandatory byelection in 1850. Hopkins, supported by Cameron, chose to run against him, and was the winner in what turned out to be a very vicious campaign. As one of the five Clear Grits in the Legislative Assembly, he was effective in opposition, and helped to bring down the Baldwin-Lafontaine ministry in 1851. Hopkins chose not to run in the resulting election and retired from politics, later moving to Hamilton in 1870. Hopkins came to be known as \"a grand old man of Ontario Liberalism\". He died in Toronto in 1880 at the home of his son-in-law William Leggo. At his death, he was the oldest parliamentarian in all of Canada, and his pallbearers included Alexander Mackenzie and Oliver Mowat. He was buried at the Toronto Necropolis.\n",

Located at what is now 10523 100 Avenue, the building was constructed as a larger replacement to the much smaller first Dominion Lands Office in Edmonton (which is now represented at Fort Edmonton Park). It housed the \"Crown Land, Timber and Registry Office for the District of Alberta in the North-West Territories\". This was the place that settlers registered their claims (land title) to free lands under the Dominion Lands Act. The design of the building is based on a basic plan drawn up by Thomas Fuller, Chief Architect of the Dominion, but is similar to the design of a typical Hudson's Bay Company warehouse. The original design is a bisymmetrical fenestration pattern, which includes a jerkinshead roof with narrow, hipped dormers. Two additions have been made to the building over its lifetime. At one point federal government attempted to move its offices across the river to the rival settlement of Strathcona, but an angry mob sabotaged the effort and there was an armed standoff with the North-West Mounted Police. In 1912 the Land Titles office moved out of the building and it became an armoury. It was then home to several different Edmonton regiments, in succession, over the next half-century: the 19th Alberta Dragoons (1915\u201339), Edmonton Fusiliers (1940\u201346), and the 19th Alberta Armoured Car Regiment (1947\u201348). Subsequently, the building became the offices and laboratories of the Provincial Government Department of Health. The building has been a Provincial Historic Resource since 1977. Since 1995, the building has the home of the Edmonton chapter of the Elizabeth Fry Society, a women's charity, which moved there from former offices in the McLeod Building.\n",

        "prefix": "In quantum mechanics, a complete set of commuting observables (CSCO) is a set of commuting operators whose eigenvalues completely specify the state of a",
        "reference": " system. Since each pair of observables in the set commutes, the observables are all compatible so that the measurement of one observable has no effect on the result of measuring another observable in the set. It is therefore not necessary to specify the order in which the different observables are measured. Measurement of the complete set of observables constitutes a complete measurement, in the sense that it projects the quantum state of the system onto a unique and known vector in the basis defined by the set of operators. That is, to prepare the completely specified state, we have to take any state arbitrarily, and then perform a succession of measurements corresponding to all the observables in the set, until it becomes a uniquely specified vector in the Hilbert space. Let us have two observables,  and, represented by  and. and  are compatible observables. and  have a common eigenbasis. The operators  and  are commuting, that is,. Proof that compatible observables commute. |Let  be a complete set of common eigenkets of the two compatible observables  and, corresponding to the sets  and  respectively. This implies, which means that the two operators commute. Proof that commuting observables possess a complete set of common eigenfunctions. Let  be a complete set of eigenkets of  corresponding to the set of eigenvalues. So, we can say that  is an eigenket of  corresponding to the eigenvalue. Since both  and  are eigenkets associated with the same non-degenerate eigenvalue, they can differ at most by a multiplicative constant. We call this constant. which means  is an eigenket of, and thus of  and  simultaneously. We suppose  is  -fold degenerate. Since, we reason as above to find that  is an eigenket of  corresponding to the degenerate eigenvalue. The  are the expansion coefficients. We now sum over all  with  constants. This constitutes a system of  linear equations for the constants. This is an equation of order  in, and has  roots. For each root  we have a value of, say,. is simultaneously an eigenket of  and  with eigenvalues  and  respectively. We consider the two above observables  and. Suppose there exists a complete set of kets  whose every element is simultaneously an eigenket of  and. Then we say that  and  are compatible. If the system happens to be in one of the eigenstates, say,, then both  and  can be simultaneously measured to any arbitrary level of precision, and we will get the results  and  respectively. This idea can be extended to more than two observables. The Cartesian components of the position operator  are,  and. These components are all compatible. Similarly, the Cartesian components of the momentum operator, that is,  and  are also compatible. All the observables commute in pairs. If we specify the eigenvalues of all the operators in the CSCO, we identify a unique eigenvector in the Hilbert space of the system. If we are given a CSCO, we can choose a basis for the space of states made of common eigenvectors of the corresponding operators. We can uniquely identify each eigenvector by the set of eigenvalues it corresponds to. Let us have an operator  of an observable, which has all non-degenerate eigenvalues. As a result, there is one unique eigenstate corresponding to each eigenvalue, allowing us to label these by their respective eigenvalues. For example, the eigenstate of  corresponding to the eigenvalue  can be labelled as. Such an observable is itself a self-sufficient CSCO. However, if some of the eigenvalues of  are degenerate (such as having degenerate energy levels), then the above result no longer holds. In such a case, we need to distinguish between the eigenfunctions corresponding to the same eigenvalue. To do this, a second observable is introduced (let us call that ), which is compatible with . The compatibility theorem tells us that a common basis of eigenfunctions of  and  can be found. Now if each pair of the eigenvalues  uniquely specifies a state vector of this basis, we claim to have formed a CSCO: the set. The degeneracy in  is completely removed. It may so happen, nonetheless, that the degeneracy is not completely lifted. That is, there exists at least one pair  which does not uniquely identify one eigenvector. In this case, we repeat the above process by adding another observable, which is compatible with both  and. If the basis of common eigenfunctions of,  and  is unique, that is, uniquely specified by the set of eigenvalues, then we have formed a CSCO:. If not, we add one more compatible observable and continue the process till a CSCO is obtained. The same vector space may have distinct complete sets of commuting operators. Suppose we are given a finite CSCO. where  are the eigenkets of the operators, and form a basis space. If we measure  in the state  then the probability that we simultaneously measure  is given by. For a complete set of commuting operators, we can find a unique unitary transformation which will simultaneously diagonalize all of them. If there is more than one such unitary transformation, then we can say that the set is not yet complete. So, any CSCO cannot involve more than one component of. It can be shown that the square of the angular momentum operator,, commutes with. Also, the Hamiltonian  is a function of  only and has rotational invariance, where  is the reduced mass of the system. Therefore, a commuting set consists of, one component of  (which is taken to be ) and. The solution of the problem tells us that disregarding spin of the electrons, the set  forms a CSCO. Let  be any basis state in the Hilbert space of the hydrogenic atom. That is, the set of eigenvalues  or more simply,  completely specifies a unique eigenstate of the Hydrogenic atom. For a free particle, the Hamiltonian is  is invariant under translations. Translation commutes with the Hamiltonian:. However, if we express the Hamiltonian in the basis of the translation operator, we will find that  has doubly degenerate eigenvalues. It can be shown that to make the CSCO in this case, we need another operator called the parity operator, such that. forms a CSCO. The degeneracy in  is removed by the momentum operator. So,  forms a CSCO. We consider the case of two systems, 1 and 2, with respective angular momentum operators  and. We can write the eigenstates of   and  as  and of  and  as. Therefore, for the complete system, the set of eigenvalues  completely specifies a unique basis state, and  forms a CSCO. Equivalently, there exists another set of basis states for the system, in terms of the total angular momentum operator. The eigenvalues of  are  where  takes on the values, and those of  are  where. The basis states of the operators  and  are. Thus we may also specify a unique basis state in the Hilbert space of the complete system by the set of eigenvalues, and the corresponding CSCO is.\n",

The j\u016bminhy\u014d is different from a koseki, which is the formal record of a family's history. In February 2009, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications announced plans to amend the current j\u016bminhy\u014d system by 2012 to include non-Japanese residents, citing government efficiency for the change. The change became effective on July 9, 2012, abolishing the alien registration system. From this date onwards, residents of both Japanese and non-Japanese citizenship are recorded in the same system. On February 12, 2002, Nishi Ward office in Yokohama issued an honorary j\u016bminhy\u014d to Tama-chan, an arctic bearded seal who took up residence in the rivers of Yokohama and Tokyo and became a national celebrity. This prompted a group of non-Japanese residents to paint whiskers on their faces and stage a protest march to demand their own j\u016bminhy\u014d. There have been other instances where local authorities have issued honorary j\u016bminhy\u014d to animals, as well as to statues, snowmen, and fictional characters.

Until July 9, 2012, only Japanese citizens were allowed to be listed on a j\u016bminhy\u014d; residents from other countries were recorded in a separate alien registration system. This two-tier resident registration system was a source of controversy within the foreign community in Japan, particularly among international families where non-Japanese family members were not listed alongside Japanese family members as being part of the same household. It was possible, however, to add a footnote in the \"bik\u014dran\" (remarks) section to a Japanese spouse's j\u016bminhy\u014d indicating that their non-Japanese spouse is the de facto head of household (\u4e8b\u5b9f\u4e0a\u306e\u4e16\u5e2f\u4e3b, jijitsu-jo no setainushi).

The film's title alludes playfully to the politicians who rule the town of Rome, since the laws that are in their favor and the tricks that make for years to stay in office. In fact the whole film as a kind of political satire and Italy was also censored. Ercole Pappalardo is an archivist who is forced to do anything not to lose his job. In fact, some of his colleagues take the dirtiest means for groped to pander to their manager, and Ercole is one of them. Ercole deeply hate Italian politics since according to him is wrong and does not provide any benefit for people in difficulties and may lose the place as him. His troubles begin when by mistake, according to a theatrical show in the gallery, sneezes the head to his audience that the director begins to not take it anymore. Since then, the career of Ercole is in real danger and the only way to save is to do the lick just like his colleagues. Among these is a particularly slimy and cunning: prof Palocco (Alberto Sordi) to obtain a seat on the upper floors with its subterfuge that also puts him to persecute the poor Ercole. In fact, during that time, Mr. Pappalardo had been entrusted with the task of recovering its director for a parrot that had endured the World War II, but that he had accidentally killed by a shot fired from a bottle cap of champagne. As if all the problems were not enough to Ercole addition, there is also a new one, because the pimp Palocco (Sordi) finds out that Ercole did the exam for primary school, and so Pappalado is forced to study again for to continue his work. The directors of the office try to pass Ercole turning a blind eye to the cause, but the cruel Palocco comes at the last moment. Here is an example of political satire and as a result of censorship: Ercole is asked the name of an elephant and he, not knowing what it was that kind replies \"De Gasperi\" (the name of the political Alcide De Gasperi, but the Italian censorship cut the joke, imposing a dubbing, so that the current joke results \"Bartali\" from Gino Bartali). Ercole is rejected and so hopes to communicate only in death his wife play the numbers on the ticket lottery. Ercole dies and finds himself to wait in the office of the High Pines to gain access to Heaven. Having waited so long for the overcrowding of divine offices, God summons Hercules and would punish him for the gesture he made. Yet when God discovers that Ercole has worked for thirty years in the archives of the Ministry, without ever being noticed and praised for what he has done with some increase in salary or grade, he sends him in Heaven. Now, finally, Ercole can make his family grow rich by communicating his lottery numbers to his wife in dreams.\n",

        "reference": " the Continental Basketball Association. They have one PBL championship and also were the two time champions of the CBA. The original team was known as the Oklahoma City Cavalry, which competed in the CBA in Oklahoma City from 1990 to 1997 \u2013 when they were league champions. Rochester won the first game of the best of three 2011 championship series 105\u2013101 (in Rochester on April 15, 2011). The new Oklahoma Cavalry, which was originally supposed to be a reincarnation of the original team and called the Oklahoma City Cavalry, began play in 2007. The team was originally scheduled to play in the American Basketball Association. The team wanted to play at Abe Lemons Arena on the campus of Oklahoma City University; however, the university backed out. Due to the lack of support from Oklahoma City and city officials' desire for a permanent NBA franchise, the owners decided to look elsewhere to place the new Cavalry franchise. The team then decided to move operations to Lawton, Oklahoma, and to play at the Great Plains Coliseum. Less than one year later, Oklahoma City got their NBA team, the Oklahoma City Thunder. The team was coached by Micheal Ray Richardson. Richardson was a former Albany Patroons coach and was fired for his offensive comments using Jewish stereotypes in the first year. Cliff Levingston was hired as the new coach. After an ownership change during the season, Richardson was rehired. In their inaugural season, the Cavs compiled a 30\u201318 record and made the playoffs as the No. 2 seed in the Western Conference. Following an upset win in the Western Conference championship game over the two-time defending CBA champion Yakima Sun Kings, the Cavalry earned a bid in the CBA Finals against the Eastern Conference champion Minot SkyRockets, where they won the series three games to two. Starting with the CBA Finals, the team changed its name to the Lawton-Fort Sill Cavalry to better associate the team with the city they play in. Due to economic hardships, the 2008\u20132009 CBA season was shortened to February 3. The best of 3 CBA Finals pitted the No. 2 seeded Albany Patroons against the No. 1 seeded Lawton-Fort Sill Cavalry. However, due to the economy, all the games would be played in Albany. The Lawton-Fort Sill Cavalry won their 2nd straight CBA championship 2 games to 1. This CBA championship was won in overtime to the score of 109\u2013107. This was the first time in 16 years that a CBA championship was decided in overtime. In August 2009, the Cavalry announced they would join the Premier Basketball League for the 2010 season. They would compile a record of 19\u20132, and enter the playoffs the No. 1 seed. First, they dispatched the Halifax Rainmen in 2 games. Then, they would advance to play the Rochester Razorsharks, who had just eliminated the No. 2 seed Puerto Rico Capitanes, for the PBL Finals. They lost Game 1 in Rochester 110\u2013106, and would also have C Oliver Miller ejected and suspended for the remainder of the series for entering the stands to confront fans that were throwing items at Micheal Ray Richardson, who was moments earlier ejected from the game. However, the Cavalry would recover, easily taking the final 2 games of the series. With this Championship, the Cavalry have now won 3 Championships in their 3 years of existence in Lawton, having won 2 previous titles in the CBA. The Lawton-Ft. Sill Cavalry finished the 2010\u20132011 regular season with a 17\u20132 record. The team advanced to the first round of the PBL playoffs vs. the Halifax Rainmen. A loss to the Halifax Rainmen in the PBL first round of playoffs on April 7, 2011 ended the Cavalry home win streak at 33 games dating back to when they played in the CBA. The Cavalry won the next two games advancing to the PBL finals which set up a rematch of the 2010 PBL finals vs. Rochester Razorsharks. The Rochester Razorsharks won the first game of the best of 3 championship series 105\u2013101 in Rochester on April 15, 2011. Suspect officiating had marred the Razorsharks's ascent to the championship, which continued in the series. Rochester eventually won the PBL Championship two games to one, prompting the Lawton Constitution to report that the Cavalry had dropped out of the PBL. On April 19, 2011 the Cavalry announced that the team would not be returning to the PBL for a third season. The next day the Cavalry owners announced that they were suspending operations, with not being able to find a suitable league to continue as one of the factors.\n",

        "reference": " to the sunnah, the example of Muhammad. One is sitting on the left foot along the ground with the right foot upright. Another is resting on both the heels. A third way is sitting with the left thigh on the ground and both feet protruding from the right side with the right foot either upright or along the ground. In this method, the left palm leans on the left knee. This third method is implemented in the third or fourth raka'ah. There can be two occasions of sitting in a regular raka'ah. One is after the first prostration and the other is after the second prostration, sometimes referred to as the tashahhud. The first two methods of kneeling are used alternatively by Muslims after the first prostration and the during the first tashahhud. In the second tashahhud, the third method of sitting is used and the index finger is pointed towards the qibla, which is the direction of Mecca. If this is the last raka\u2019ah, the prayer is commenced in sitting position by reciting greetings of salam to the right such as \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0644\u0627\u0645 \u0639\u0644\u064a\u0643\u0645 \u0648\u0631\u062d\u0645\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 (transliteration \u201cAs-Salaamu 'alaykum wa rahmatullaah,\u201d meaning \u201cMay Allah grant you peace and security, and may His Mercy be upon you\u201d) and then similarly to the left. Muslims recite the \"tashahhud,\" referring to the shahada or the declaration of faith in Islam.

They are distinct from airships that use steam as their lifting gas, which are known as thermal airships. 1842: The Aerial Steam Carriage of William Samuel Henson and John Stringfellow was patented, but was never successful, although a steam-powered model was flown in 1848. 1852: Henri Giffard flew a 3-horsepower (2\u00a0kW) steam-powered dirigible over Paris; it was the first powered aircraft. 1861 Gustave Ponton d'Am\u00e9court made a small steam-powered craft, coining the name helicopter. 1874: F\u00e9lix du Temple flew a steam-powered aluminium monoplane off a downhill run. While it did not achieve level flight, it was the first manned heavier-than-air powered flight. 1877: Enrico Forlanini built and flew a model steam-powered helicopter in Milan. 1882: Alexander Mozhaisky built a steam-powered plane but it did not achieve sustained flight. The engine from the plane is in the Central Air Force Museum in Monino, Moscow. 1890: Cl\u00e9ment Ader built a steam-powered, bat-winged monoplane, named the Eole. Ader flew it on October 9, 1890, over a distance of, but the engine was inadequate for sustained and controlled flight. His flight did prove that a heavier-than-air flight was possible. Ader made at least three further attempts, the last two on 12 and 14 October 1897 for the French Ministry of War. There is controversy about whether or not he attained controlled flight. Ader did not obtain funding for his project, and that points to its probable failure. 1894: Sir Hiram Stevens Maxim (inventor of the Maxim Gun) built and tested a large rail-mounted, steam-powered aircraft testbed, with a mass of  and a wingspan of  in order to measure the lift produced by different wing configurations. The machine unexpectedly generated sufficient lift and thrust to break free of the test track and fly, but was never intended to be operated as a piloted aircraft and so crashed almost immediately owing to its lack of flight controls. 1896: Samuel Pierpont Langley successfully flew unpiloted steam-powered models. 1897: Carl Richard Nyberg's Flugan developed steam-powered aircraft over a period from 1897 to 1922, but they never achieved more than a few short hops. 1899: Gustave Whitehead built, and was purported to have flown, a steam-powered airplane in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Stoker/passenger Louis Darvarich was said to have been injured when the plane crashed into an upper story of an apartment building. Whitehead later claimed to have flown a steam aircraft in Hartford, Connecticut, and to have been visited by one of the Wright brothers well before 1903. Mainstream aviation historians remain unconvinced of the Whitehead claims. The flights have never been verified satisfactorily; there are no photographs, news stories, or other media from 1899 to confirm them. Likewise, the supposed visit of the Wright brothers to Whitehead is apocryphal; other than affidavits taken over thirty years after the fact, there is no evidence the visit ever happened. 1902 Lyman Gilmore claimed in 1927 to have flown a steam-powered aircraft on 15 May 1902. The flight was unconfirmed. 1920: The Bristol Tramp was to have been a steam-powered aeroplane, but the turbine was over-powered, and the construction of a reliable boiler and condenser circuit was problematic. 1931 Harry Crossland Pfaff of Chicago designed and made a steam-powered aircraft. It was to be test flown by round-the-world aviator Clyde Pangborn. There is no record of the flight being made. 1933: George D. Besler and William J. Besler's prototype steam biplane, based on a Travel Air 2000, flew several times at Oakland airport. It was powered by a two-cylinder,  double-expansion V-twin reciprocating engine weighing about, designed by the Doble Steam Motors Company and Besler. and was capable of STOL operation due to the ease of reversing the thrust. Several others were working on steam-powered flight at the time. Harold C. Johnson of Akron, Ohio, had made a  steam engine for an aircraft in autumn 1932. The Great Lakes Aircraft Company of Cleveland, Ohio, was working on a steam-powered biplane. A Paris mechanic developed a light steam-powered engine for aircraft. Swedish steam turbine engineers were working on an aircraft engine, and G. A. Raffaelli, an Italian aeronautical engineer, published a paper in 1931 on a steam-powered engine for stratospheric flight. 1934: Newspapers of the time reported a steam-powered aircraft designed by a Mr Huettner, Chief Engineer of the Klingenberg Electric Works in Berlin, that used revolving boiler combined with a steam turbine. The plane was reported to have a design speed of  and be capable of 60 to 70 hours non-stop flight. The Berlin reporter of the Czechoslovak Prager Tagblatt, who wrote the article, was arrested, and no more was heard of the project. 1938: A British company, Aero Turbines Limited, designed a steam turbine engine similar to Huettner's. The company ceased to exist in 1948. 1944: A steam-powered version of the Messerschmitt Me 264A Amerika Bomber was hypothesized but never constructed. It was to be powered by a steam turbine developing over  while driving a -diameter propeller. The fuel would have been a mixture of powdered coal and petroleum. It seems that the steam turbines would have had an SFC of 190\u00a0gr/hp/hr. The main advantages of this powerplant were considered to be that it produced consistent power at all altitudes and required low maintenance. 1960s: Conceptual drawings were made for Don Johnson of Thermodynamic Systems Inc., Newport Beach, California, of a steam engine to be installed in a Hughes 300 helicopter.\n",

In contrast to gametogenesis in animals, a gametangium is a haploid structure and formation of gametes does not involve meiosis. Depending on the type of gamete produced in a gametangium, several types can be distinguished. Female gametangia are most commonly called archegonia. They produce egg cells and are the sites for fertilization. Archegonia are common in algae and primitive plants as well as gymnosperms. In flowering plants, they are replaced by the embryo sac inside the ovule. The male gametangia are most commonly called antheridia. They produce sperm cells that they release for fertilization. Antheridia producing non-motile sperm (spermatia) are called spermatangia. Some antheridia do not release their sperm. For example, the oomycete antheridium is a syncytium with many sperm nuclei and fertilization occurs via fertilization tubes growing from the antheridium and making contact with the egg cells. Antheridia are common in the gametophytes in \"lower\" plants such as bryophytes, ferns, cycads and ginkgo. In \"higher\" plants such as conifers and flowering plants, they are replaced by pollen grains. In isogamy, the gametes look alike and cannot be classified into \"male\" or \"female\". For example, in zygomycetes, two gametangia (single multinucleate cells at the end of hyphae) form good contact with each other and fuse into a zygosporangium. Inside the zygosporangium, the nuclei from each of the original two gametangia pair up.\n",

In 1982, Mary O'Coner and Sue Trotter, fellow Junior Leaguers and longtime neighbors in Brookwood Hills, decided to pursue a science museum for Atlanta. SciTrek was incorporated in 1982, with an initial grant from the Metropolitan Foundation. The Metropolitan Foundation is a nonprofit corporation guided by a 31-member board of directors headed by Robert W. Scherer, the Georgia Power Co. chairman and chief executive officer. With help from the city of Atlanta, the city committed 96,000 square feet of the Atlanta Civic Center exhibition space to the Science and Technology Museum of Atlanta. The Robert W. Woodruff Foundation donated $1 million. After years of planning and fundraising SciTrek-The Science & Technology Museum of Atlanta finally opened its doors to the public on October 29, 1988. SciTrek opened with 34 staffers, 150 volunteers, and a $2. 5 million annual budget. During the three-day grand opening, 11,000 visitors toured the museum. By the end of its first full fiscal year, Scitrek reported 350,000 visitors to the museum. Museum organizers projected attendance would eventually reach 1 million. In 1991, SciTrek reported more than 750,000 visitors, most of whom were schoolchildren. In April 1997, Gwen Crider, former deputy director of the Smithsonian Institution's National Air and Space Museum, replaced Gene Brandt as president and executive director of SciTrek. In the October 2001 issue of Good Housekeeping magazine, SciTrek was named one of the country's 10 best science museums. Even after suffering a 24 percent drop-off in visitors between 1993 through 1999, SciTrek decided during the 1999 fiscal year to retire its long-standing debt of $3 million. On December 1, 2000, Lewis A. Massey, former Georgia secretary of state, took over as SciTrek president and chief executive officer. By January 2001, SciTrek's finances were in dire condition, having lost $80,000 to $100,000 a month over the previous six months. The museum had a deficit for the previous three years, reaching $700,000 for fiscal 2000. The board extended a 90-day reprieve for SciTrek instead of closing it down immediately. By June 2001, the State of Georgia, which had provided an annual $175,000 grant to SciTrek, threw in an additional $300,000 to help keep the museum afloat. During August 2002 the following year the Georgia Assembly allocated $425,000 to SciTrek and began a capital campaign to help raise $5 million. In January 2003, the Challenger Learning Center, a $1. 7 million simulated space shuttle mission, opened to the public. In December 2003, SciTrek named technology industry executive, Scott Coleman, as president and CEO, replacing Massey, who left to join a lobbying firm. In June 2003, the Georgia Department of Education budget for the 2004 fiscal year cut funding for SciTrek by 10 percent. SciTrek housed more than 140 exhibits appealing to all age ranges. The interactive displays offered visitors the opportunity to explore and discover the marvels of the scientific world, with a special Kidscape section specially designed for the two to seven years age group. The \"Mathematica: A World of Numbers. and Beyond\" exhibit detailed the major achievements in the history of mathematics from the twelfth century as well as explaining mathematical formulae including Kepler's laws of planetary motion and probability theory. Other exhibits focused on electricity generation in unusual ways, creating energy from magnetism, 'freezing shadows' or stepping inside a kaleidoscope. SciTrek's Challenger Learning Center is a $1. 7 million, simulated NASA space shuttle mission which opened to the public in January 2003. Upon SciTrek's initial closure the Challenger Learning Center was put up for auction. Several museums and science centers expressed interest in acquiring the Challenger Learning Center for their facility. None of the entrusted facilities or museums were able to come up with the purchasing cost of $1. 7 million. As a result, Challenger Learning Center, with its advanced computers and flight technology, was almost sent to the scrap yard. Turner Broadcasting System stepped in and raised the money needed to purchase SciTrek's Challenger Learning Center, which was relocated and donated to Atlanta's Fernbank Science Center. SciTrek's name, intellectual property, computers, materials from the Edison exhibit, science education curriculum and programs were transferred to Valdosta State University in 2005. The new SciTrek is closed to the public, but serves as an educational center for teachers and students in South Georgia. STARS: SciTrek Amateur Radio Society operated W4WOW, the Amateur Radio Station located in SciTrek. STARS operated on CW, SSB, FM, and PSK-31 frequencies along with others. The frequency bands most often used by the group were HF, UHF, and VHF. When SciTrek was in operation, the group met on the first Sunday of every month at the ham radio Station in the Museum. In August 2004, a charter school, call Tech High, opened inside the SciTrek Civic Center building. The school was a public-private hybrid.\n",

The Bostick Golf Course is located on  of softly rolling terrain on the northwest corner of the university campus, adjoining S.W. 34th Street and S.W. 2nd Avenue, and less than a mile from the central undergraduate campus. It is heavily lined with trees, and includes over 140 bunkers. The facilities include the Guy Bostick Club House, and a dedicated practice area for the Gators men's and women's golf teams. The course is named for Mark Bostick, president of Comcar Industries and a generous donor to the Florida Gators athletics program. The course was formerly the home of the Gainesville Country Club, and was acquired by the university in 1963. Noted Scottish golfer and golf course architect Donald Ross designed the course in 1921, when it was originally owned and operated by the country club. In 2001, golf course architect Bobby Weed renovated the facility, with $4 million in private donations. As part of the renovation, the course length was stretched by 500 yards, to a total length just over 6,700 yards, and re-rated as a par 70. MacCurrach Golf Construction, Inc. was the primary construction contractor. When completed in November 2001, the University Athletic Association celebrated the occasion with \"Gator Golf Day,\" an alumni golf event that included former Gator golf greats. The Mark Bostick Golf Course hosts the annual Gator Invitational and Lady Gator Invitational tournaments, as well as the annual Gator Golf Day alumni event. The course has also served as the site for the NCAA Regional tournament on several occasions, including 2009. The club house has served a faculty club meeting place, and a venue for student organization events. University of Florida students, faculty, staff and alumni may play the course. Tee times may be scheduled in advance, Friday through Sunday. The par and yardage shown are from the orange tees, which may be played only with permission from the course management. Players can play from the shorter blue, white or red (ladies) tees without course permission.

Guerin grew up in South Philadelphia and attended parochial schools. He graduated from Roman Catholic High School. He attended Temple University in pursuit of a bachelor of laws degree, attending at night while working in a law office. In 1923, Guerin was admitted to the bar even before finishing the degree. Because he was not yet 21 years old, his admission required a special exception; he finished the LL.B. degree the following year. After being admitted to the bar, Guerin opened a law practice with a classmate, John S. McEvoy. He later worked as a state deputy attorney general and as counsel to the state liquor control board. In 1928, he married Mary C. Henry. Like his father, Guerin became involved in local politics, but in the opposing party; he often said he was the first Democrat in his family. He was an unsuccessful candidate for Philadelphia district attorney in 1939. He served in the United States Navy in World War II. In 1951, he was elected to Philadelphia City Council from South Philadelphia's 1st district, part of a Democratic wave that swept the Republicans from power for the first time in 67 years. In Council, he chaired the Public Property and Works Committee. In 1954, Guerin joined the efforts James Hugh Joseph Tate and Michael J. Towey to weaken the civil service reforms of the new charter, but they were unsuccessful. He was re-elected in 1955 with an increased majority. The following year, he became ill with cancer. After an operation at Philadelphia's Hahnemann University Hospital, he died in his home at the age of 53.

        "prefix": "Archaeological Museum of Epidaurus is a museum in Epidaurus, in Argolis on the Peloponnese peninsula, Greece. The museum",
        "reference": ", noted for its reconstructions of temples and its columns and inscriptions, was established in 1902 and opened in 1909 to display artifacts unearthed in the ancient site of Epidaurus in the surrounding area. The ancient site of Epidaurus was dedicated to healing and the gods Apollo and Asklepios. The oldest area of the site is a Mycenaean sanctuary dedicated to a healing goddess, which stands on the Kynortion hill; it was founded in the sixteenth century BC on a ruined settlement of the Early and Middle Bronze Age (2800-1800 BC). It lasted until the eleventh century BC, and then in about 800 BC it was rededicated to Apollo and the area is now known as the Apollo sanctuary. The other main sanctuary, the Asclepeion sanctuary of Epidaurus, was first studied by the French Scientific Expedition of the Peloponnese in 1829. In 1870, Panagiotis Kavadias of the Greek Archaeological Society began excavating the site, and over the decades that followed discovered an extensive array of artifacts. The bulk of the collection was unearthed mostly by Karvadias in two main sanctuaries of Asklepios and Apollo in Epidaurus, the older sanctuary of Apollo Maleatas on Mt. Kynortion and the later Asclepeion in the plain. The Asclepeion, the larger of the sanctuaries was known for its healing rituals and for hosting sports. The size of the partial reconstructions of the most important monuments of the Asklepeion and growing collection meant that between 1902 and 1909, Kavadias built the Museum of Epidaurus to store the finds. The sculptures which had been transferred directly to the National Archaeological Museum of Athens were replaced by plaster casts to display in the museum. After Kavadias's death in 1926, only limited excavations of Epidaurus took place, such as by G. Roux of the French School at Athens in the area of the Abaton in 1942-43, and by I. Papadimitriou of the Greek Archaeological Service in 1948-51. A. Orlandos undertook the restoration of the theatre between 1954 and 1963 and unearthed new objects, which led to the expansion of the museum in 1958, with a storeroom built in the northwest end of the archaeological site, and storerooms to house sculpture and pottery added to the northeast of the museum. In 1971, the museum underwent expansion again when a new hall was built to the northwest of the main building to accommodate a collection of inscriptions. Since 1974 excavations by the Archaeological Society at the sanctuary of Apollo Maleatas have been conducted under Professor V. Lambrinoudakis. A special committee of the Ministry of Culture was founded in 1984 under the name of Work Group for the Restoration of the Monuments of Epidaurus known as the Committee for the Restoration of the Monuments of Epidaurus which is responsible for the conservation of the site and presentation of the monuments in both sanctuaries. In 1992, when the partial reconstruction of the Tholos temple of Asklepios was dismantled to undergo examination, a temporary exhibition was placed in the second gallery of the museum, which provides photographs and explanations of its architectural parts. The museum contains a number of large reconstructions of temples and architectural components, particularly those found at the Asklepieion. Of major note is the reconstruction of part of the entablature and Doric columns of the Temple of Asklepios dated to 380\u2013375 B.C. and reconstruction of part of the entablature of the Temple of Artemis, dated to 370\u2013310 B.C. There is also an extensive reconstruction of the entablature and part of the inner Corinthian colonnade of the Propylaia dated to 300 B.C. The museum also has a Corinthian capital which was unearthed below the foundations of the Tholos temple; that temple is believed to be designed by Polykleitos the Younger. The temporary exhibition of architectural parts and sculptures from the Tholos, added in 1992, is located in a room which is known as the \"B gallery\". The museum has a substantial collection of inscriptions and Greek and Roman sculptures. The main collection of inscriptions has been housed in the special hall to the northeast of the main building since 1958 as has a storeroom for the sculptures, a pottery room, and a restoration workshop. A collection of inscriptions is also displayed under the portico to the south of the main building of the Epidauras Archaeological Museum. The museum has a plaster cast statue of Asklepios, with a sacred snake curling up on his stick. It is a copy of the original statue unearthed in Epidaurus and which is exhibited in the National Archaeological Museum of Athens. Also of note is a marble headless statue, believed to be of the health goddess Hygeia, dated to the Hellenistic period and a statuette of a child. The museum has a collection of votive inscriptions and perirrhanteria, displayed at the facade of the inscriptions hall. There is a fragment of a votive relief and Doric metopes, which are decorated with relief scenes, one of which depicts Asklepios and Athena, and are dated to the end of the 4th or the beginning of the 3rd century B.C. A lily from the ceiling of the Tholos decorates one of the coffers of the ceiling of the external Doric colonnade of the Tholos which is dated to 360\u2013330 B.C. The museum also displays bronze medical instruments providing an informative insight into medical practice at the sanctuary of Asklepios. Another notable display are the fossils unearthed at Epidaurus and other places in Greece, an array of minerals found in the area of Lavrio, and a collection of ancient ammonites which are believed to be over 240 million years old.\n",

The Book of Hours, known as the  Hours of Jeanne d'Evreux, is in The Cloisters collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. It was commissioned from the artist Jean Pucelle between 1324 and 1328, probably as a gift from her husband. The book contains the usual prayers of the canonical hours as arranged for the laity along with the notable inclusion of the office dedicated to St Louis, her great-grandfather.

        "reference": " 2012. Aged 17, Hallam had been sentenced to serve a minimum of 12 years in prison for the murder of a trainee chef, Essayas Kassahun, during a street brawl in Old Street. Two witnesses claimed to have seen him at the scene, but their evidence was unreliable, with one witness attempting to go back on his statement in court, and another saying, \"I just wanted someone to blame on the spot, really\". No other evidence, forensic or otherwise, existed to link him to the scene, and Hallam always maintained he was not there, although he had no alibi to prove it. Friends and family of Hallam asked veteran human-rights campaigner Paul May to set up a campaign to prove his innocence. May mounted a legal appeal for Hallam and arranged numerous events and media interviews to publicise the case. Playwright Tess Berry-Hart created a verbatim theatre play Someone To Blame as part of the campaign to raise awareness of the case. The play used verbatim court transcripts, witness testimony and first-person interviews from the original case and ran at the King's Head Theatre Islington in February 2012. In 2007 there was a failed appeal with the judges holding that the evidence of the witnesses could still be relied upon. The case was then referred to the Criminal Cases Review Commission, which spent three years examining his case. Thames Valley Police was instructed on their behalf to examine the original Metropolitan Police investigation. Based on their findings, the case was sent back to the Court of Appeal. In May 2012 after only three hours hearing, the Crown Prosecution Service decided not to defend the conviction, and the three judges led by Lady Justice Hallett granted temporary bail. Hallam walked out the front doors of the Court of Appeal and was drenched in champagne. The next day, Hallam attended court with his mother Wendy Cohen to hear his murder conviction formally overturned. After Sam's release, Someone To Blame was updated for a weekend run at the King's Head to celebrate his freedom. Sadly, Hallam's father and grandmother had both died whilst he was imprisoned. Hallam launched a legal challenge in January 2015 challenging the law that prevents him from receiving compensation for the years he wrongly spent in prison.\n",

        "prefix": "Victor Lundin (June 15, 1930 \u2013 June 29, 2013) was an American character actor who is best remembered as appearing in the 1964 science fiction film",
        "reference": " Robinson Crusoe on Mars as the character Friday and for having later portrayed the first Klingon seen on screen in the Star Trek television franchise. He also appeared in films directed by Robert Wise and George Stevens, as well as in other television series such as Batman and The Time Tunnel. Lundin was born in Chicago, Illinois, on Dec 8, 1929. His father was from a German American background, and his mother was English. He wanted to work in films from a young age, after enjoying watching them at the cinema where his father worked. While attending Lane Technical College Prep High School, Lundin trained as an opera singer and was on the baseball team. During this time, he would take on small roles in broadcast radio productions being produced in Chicago, such as Mystery Theater and Captain Midnight. He began to play semi-pro baseball as a pitcher for the Skokie Indians, but an injury to his throwing arm in his second game ended his career. Lundin began to study music at Roosevelt University, but after a year won a part in the Lyric Opera of Chicago's performance of Don Giovanni, which created an opportunity for him to study abroad in Italy. But he turned this down, instead opting to move to California to pursue his acting dream. He went on to attend Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles, where he graduated with a B.A. in Communications Arts and Literature. He began to find work in Hollywood, not as an actor but as a singer. He appeared on the variety show Hootenanny as a folk musician and made 24 appearances on The Red Rowe Show in this same capacity. He recorded a handful of songs, later explaining, \"We had a couple turntable hits, but the distribution was poor. They didn't get enough going in sales to do an album\". While pursuing his acting career, Lundin also worked as a salesman and a food distributor. He became known for his portrayal of tough men on screen, as well as Native Americans. By Lundin's own estimation, he made more than a 100 different film and television appearances from the late 1950s to the late 1960s. These included such roles as Machine Gun Kelly in the 1960s film Ma Barker's Killer Brood. During the early 1960s, he worked with two Academy Award winning directors, Robert Wise and George Stevens. With Wise, he appeared in the director's 1962 film Two for the Seesaw, and in Stevens' The Greatest Story Ever Told in 1965. Lundin also appeared in a number of other films around this same period, including Promises! Promises! (1963) and Beau Geste (1966). In 1964, he also starred in one of the lead roles in Robinson Crusoe on Mars as Friday. During this period, he also worked as a singing coach, working with Lucille Ball for a period, but he said \"I couldn't teach her anything. She was such a heavy smoker; she was like a basso profundo\". Lundin appeared in several 1960's science fiction and superhero television series, such as Batman as one of the Penguin's henchmen, and as Chief Standing Pat in separate episodes. In 1967, he appeared in the Star Trek: The Original Series episode \"Errand of Mercy\", the first time that the Klingons made an appearance in the Star Trek franchise. Lundin portrayed the Klingon Lieutenant, and became the first Klingon to be seen on screen by virtue of walking into frame moments before John Colicos' Kor. Lundin had previously auditioned for the role of Spock, which wound up going to Leonard Nimoy instead. He also appeared in other series such as The Time Tunnel and later in his career in Babylon 5. He was a regular at science fiction conventions, and continued to sing professionally, including making an appearance on a cruise in the early 2000s. Lundin married Christa Friedlander in 1961 and had three children; two sons and a daughter. The marriage ended in 1972 and he retained custody of their 3 children. He raised his three children alone and later met Amelia Pryharski with whom he would spend the last 20 years of his life. He was involved with charities, including the Child Welfare League of America. Following a lengthy illness, Lundin died on July 02, 2013 in Thousand Oaks, California, despite the date of his death being given (twice) in the reference as June 29.\n",

        "prefix": "Neo-Zionism is a right-wing, nationalistic and religious ideology that appeared in Israel following the Six-Day War in 1967 and the capture",
        "reference": " of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Neo-Zionists consider these lands part of Israel and advocate their settlement by Israeli Jews. Some advocate the transfer of Arabs not only from these areas but also from within the Green Line. The term \"Post-Zionism\" entered Israeli discourse following the publishing of a book by Uri Ram in 1993. In the same volume, Gershom Shafir contrasted Post-Zionism with what he termed Neo-Zionism. In a widely cited 1996 essay, sociologist Uri Ram used the term Neo-Zionism to describe a political and religious ideology that developed in Israel following the 1967 Six-Day War. He considers it as an \"exclusionary, nationalist, even racist, and antidemocratic political-cultural trend\" in Israel that evolved in parallel with, and in opposition to, the left-wing politics of Post-Zionism and Labor Zionism. Uri Ram contends that Neo-Zionism is not a new phenomenon, instead arguing that it emerged from the Six-Day War in 1967 and the conquest of Jerusalem. Ram contends that Jerusalem is the symbolic capital of Neo-Zionism, while Post-Zionism is orientated around Tel Aviv. It rose with the anxiety following the near loss of the 1973 war. Neo-Zionists consider \"secular Zionism\", particularly the labor version, as too weak on nationalism and that it never understood the impossibility of Arabs and Jews living together in peace. Neo-Zionists claim that the Arab attitude to Israel is inherently rooted in anti-Semitism and that it is a Zionist illusion to think living in peace and together with them is possible. They consider Arabs in Israel to be a fifth column and to pose a demographic threat to the Jewish majority in Israel. From their point of view, the only solution for achieving peace is through \"deterrence and retaliation\" or preferably \"transfer by agreement\" of the Israeli Arabs and the Palestinian population of the occupied Palestinian Territories to neighboring Arab states. Uri Ram characterizes both Neo-Zionism and Post-Zionism as reactions to the post-nationalist environment. For Neo-Zionism, \"the weakness of Israeli Nationalism derives from his alienation of Jewish sources and culture (. Only a new national-religious and orthodox coalition [could] cure Zionism of this moral bankruptcy\". Neo-Zionists consider all areas under Israeli military control to be part of \"the biblical Land of Israel\". Neo-Zionists assert that the goal of Jewish statehood is not only about creating a safe refuge for Jews but also about the national-historic destiny of the people of Israel in the land of Israel. For Uri Ram, Neo-Zionism is a reinterpretation of Zionism that is religious rather than secular. Judaism, instead of being a peripheral cultural tradition, is a core element in his definition. In Ram's formulation, Post-Zionism is globalist and liberal, while Neo-Zionism is local and ethno-religious. Asima Ghazi-Bouillon challenges Ram's classification of Neo-Zionism as anti-globalist. He instead sees some strains of Neo-Zionism as globalist, similar to Neo-Conservatism and Neo-Nationalism. Whereas Post-Zionism was a largely unsuccessful direct challenge to Zionism, Neo-Zionism is instead a challenge to Labour Zionism. Asima Ghazi-Bouillon argues that Neo-Zionism is not entirely an ethno-religious movement but also incorporates a national security discourse. Ilan Papp\u00e9 sees four currents which have contributed to Neo-Zionism\u2019s rise: The conversion of the  Haredim to Zionism; the settler movement combined with the state funding of Yeshivas; the culturally insular and economically deprived Mizrahi community; and finally the integration of Israel into the global capitalist system. Uri Ram uses the Movement for Greater Israel and the Gush Emunim settler movement founded in 1974 as examples of Neo-Zionism and its precursors, Gush Emunim being a hybrid of religion and nationalism. Ram also labels parts of Likud and the National Religious Party, as well as other, smaller, splinter parties including Yisrael BaAliyah, Moledet, Tehiya and Tzomet as Neo-Zionist. In the media Neo-Zionism is associated with Arutz Sheva. According to Yishai Fleisher, Arutz Sheva director of programming and founder of the Kumah neo-Zionist lobby, \"Zionism is the yearning of the Jewish people to come back to the land of Israel with the creation of the Jewish commonwealth and the era of the third Temple. It's a renewal of lost values, and an answer to post-Zionism. If post-Zionism is the theory that Israel was created and the project is now finished, then neo-Zionism states that we are far from done with the project. The Jewish people are not yet back home, and we have yet to educate Jews to the concept of living a Torah life in the land of Israel\". Some associations in Israel, such as Im Tirtzu, defend Neo-Zionist ideology. Ronen Shoval, founder of the association states that \"We need every Jewish heart and Zionist soul. Coordinators and activists of Im Tirtzu are hereby called to the flag. ) [W]e will turn the Hebrew University into a Zionist society, and continue the second Zionist revolution\"! His aims are \"to restore Zionism to the center - for poets to poetize Zionism, for the writers to write Zionism, for academia to support Zionism and for the Ari Folmans (. ) to make films about our ethos. Just as there are movies about gladiators, we will have movies about Judah Maccabee. What's wrong with that\"? According to Uri Ram, \"Neo-Zionism (. ) is an exclusionary, nationalist, even racist, and antidemocratic political-cultural trend, striving to heighten the fence encasing Israeli identity\"; a point of view also reported by Gilbert Achcar. According to Dana Eyal, \"[her] country is hijacked by a group of racist religious Jews, who are much more of a threat to Israel than any Arab or Muslim country, including Iran\". She gives the example of children of illegal immigrants born and living in Israel for years and that neo-Zionist groups want to see expelled because their presence is un-Zionistic. She thinks that \"[t]his very narrow definition of Zionism dictates that Israel is and will remain a racist Jewish state\" but also \"that in Israel itself there is a (lazy) majority that is far from this. Zionism for us equals patriotism much like it does to Americans; wanting the best for your country, believing in its principals and defending it when necessary. Only we don't believe in many of the neo-orthodox principals popping out like mushrooms in the rain. For that matter, we no longer feel very Zionistic in an environment that embraces totality and purity of race (a calamitous similarity to things that should not be named)\". Post-Zionists have argued that Israel must choose between a Post-Zionist future and a Neo-Zionist future. Today, Israeli centrists have come to view both \"Post-Zionism\" and \"Neo-Zionism\" positions as threats to their position.\n",

He was the first African American to serve three terms in legislature and also the first one to be nominated as the Speaker of the House. After emancipation, his family moved to a farm in Haywood County, Tennessee in 1866. He attended Freedmen\u2019s Bureau Schools where he was taught by his former slave master\u2019s children. Therefore, he moved quickly through school. In 1875, he attended Oberlin College in Ohio for a year. Then he returned to south and taught at a school for three years. He studied Latin, German, and mathematics with a Vanderbilt student whose recommendation got him a Peabody Scholarship to Fisk University. In 1878, he enrolled at the Fisk University and graduated in 1883. While still a student at the University, he got elected to the General Assembly from Haywood County. He opened up a grocery store in Haywood County and started reading law on his own. While serving in legislature he attended the law school of Central Tennessee College in Nashville, and obtained a law degree in 1886. During his second term, he was nominated by a former U.S. Senator Roderick R. Butler to be the speaker of the House of Representatives in 1885, and received 32 of the 93 votes. He was the head of the Tennessee Republican Convention and was a delegate to the national convention in Chicago in 1884. He was the first African American to be elected three times for a legislative term in Tennessee. He had spoken at the Tuskegee Institute as a commencement speaker in 1887. During the same year, in his third term he proposed a bill that would ensure fairer jury selection. The bill was tabled by a vote of 41-36. He served during an era when Jim Crowism was in effect. In 1888, he campaigned for a fourth term, but was not elected. This was due to voting fraud and intimidation. McElwee and his family left the Haywood County because of violence against African Americans. He had established a newspaper and a law firm in Nashville, but then he and his family, again moved to Chicago in July 1901. He also started a law practice there and spent the rest of his life there.

Action by large clostridial toxins (LCTs) from Clostridium difficile includes four  steps: (1) receptor-mediated endocytosis, (2) translocation of a catalytic glucosyltransferase domain across the membrane, (3) release of the enzymatic part by auto-proteolysis, and (4) inactivation of Rho family proteins. Cleavage of toxin B and all other large clostridial cytotoxins, is an autocatalytic process dependent on host cytosolic inositolphosphate cofactors. A covalent inhibitor of aspartate proteases, 1,2-epoxy-3-(p-nitrophenoxy)propane or EPNP, completely blocks toxin B function on cultured cells and has been used to identify the catalytically active protease site. The toxin uses eukaryotic signals for induced autoproteolysis to deliver its toxic domain into the cytosol of target cells. Reineke et al. Clostridium difficile infection, caused by the actions of the homologous toxins TcdA and TcdB on colonic epithelial cells is due to binding to target cells which triggers toxin internalization into acidified vesicles, whereupon cryptic segments from within the 1,050-aa translocation domain unfurl and insert into the bounding membrane, creating a transmembrane passageway to the cytosol. Sensitive residues-clustered between amino acyl residues 1,035 and 1,107, when individually mutated, reduced cellular toxicity by >1,000-fold. Defective variants exhibit impaired pore formation in planar lipid bilayers and biological membranes, resulting in an inability to intoxicate cells through either apoptotic or necrotic pathways. The findings suggest similarities between the pore-forming 'hotspots' of TcdB and the diphtheria toxin translocation domain. Proteolytically processed clostridial cytotoxins A (306 kDa; TC# 1. 57. 2) and B (269 kDa; TC# 1. 57. 1) are O-glycosyltransferases that modify small GTPases of the Rho family by glucosylation of threonine residues, thereby blocking the action of the GTPases as switches of signal processes such as those mediated by the actin cytoskeleton. The toxins thus induce redistribution of actin filaments and cause the cells to round up. The catalytic domains of CCTs probably enter the cytoplasm from acidic endosomes. The toxins form ion-permeable channels in cell membranes and artificial bilayers when exposed to acidic pH. pH-dependent channel formation has been demonstrated for C. difficile Toxin B and C as well as Clostridium sordellii lethal toxin (TcsL). Low pH presumably induces conformational/structural changes that promote membrane insertion and channel formation. Cytotoxins of the CCT family are large (e.g., toxin B of C. difficile is 2366 aas long) and tripartite with the N-terminal domain being the catalytic unit, the C-terminal domain being the cellular receptor and the central hydrophobic domain being the channel-former. In this respect, they superficially resemble diphtheria toxin (DT; TC# 1. 7) although no significant sequence similarity between CCTs and DT is observed. The E. coli toxin B protein (TC# 1. 57. 1) and the Chlamydial TC0437 protein (TC# 1. 57. 2) are of 3169 aas and 3255 aas, respectively. The distantly related ToxA toxin of Pasteurella multocida (TC# 1. 57. 1) is 1285 aas while the E. coli Cnf1 and 2 toxins(TC#s 1. 57. 2 and 1. 57. 3, respectively) are 1014 aas, and the RTX cytotoxin of Vibrio vulnificus (TC# 1. 57. 4) is 5206 aas.\n",

This was in the time of constructivism. Due to his communist militancy, he was imprisoned for several years in the prison of Burgos. In 1963, when an exhibition of his work in London was mounted, a critic compared his work with Goya's The Disasters of War. In the 1980s he began sculpting; his singular vision of the pictorial work the Forest of Oma, near Guernica, is perhaps his best known work. His work combines the Basque spirit with the social commitment of the humblest workers, people who tend towards expressionism. One of his last and most spectacular works was Cubes of Memory, in the port of Llanes. In recent year he has been tied to the founder of the platform \u00a1Basta Ya!, a civic group fighting against terrorism in the Basque Country. Due to his bitter opposition to ETA, a group proscribed as terrorist by the Spanish state, Ibarrola has been threatened by ETA. He has been awarded the Medal of the Order of the Constitutional Merit.

After Transkei was reincorporated into South Africa, Matanzima joined the South African National Defence Force (SANDF), leaving the military as a colonel in 1996. Born on December 15, 1949, Matanzima was one of the four sons of George Matanzima (1918-2000). His father would later become the Prime Minister of Transkei and the leader of the now defunct Transkei National Independence Party. Qaqambile Matanzima began his career as a teacher at the Mncuncuzo Junior Secondary in Cofimvaba, South Africa. He then joined the Transkei Defence Force (TDF) when he was 36 years old in 1975, shortly before Transkei was declared independent by South Africa. He achieved the rank of colonel in the TDF. In 1986 and 1987, Transki Prime Minister George Matanzima and several other Transkei politicians were implicated in a scandal over the embezzlement of funding originally intended for a housing project. Under pressure from South Africa to resolve the crisis, the Transkei Defence Force served papers on September 3, 1987, ordering Prime Minister George Mathanzima and six Transkei cabinet minister to reign from office. Prime Minister Mathanzima and the six ministers resigned from office on October 2, 1987, completing the military coup. Qaqambile Matanzima, a colonel within the TDF at the time, sided with the military during the takeover. Qaqambile Matanzima was among the senior members of the Transkei military who planned the removal of his father from office. He did not alert his father or his father's political allies of the military's plans. In 2013, following Qaqambile Matanzima's death, the President of the United Democratic Movement Bantu Holomisa, a former Transkei Defence Force officer who led the 1987 military coups, recalled Qaqambile Matanzima's support for the 1987 ouster of the Prime Minister, noting that Matanzima had to choose between his family and the military. Holomisa told reporters, \"He was part of the senior military officers who planned a coup to remove his own father, George Matanzima, who was prime minister at the time. He showed great loyalty to the military. He did not even tip-off his father. He was part of those who wanted to uproot fraud and corruption and ensure clean governance in the Transkei government. This is great loss\". Matanzima's father, former Prime Minister George Matanzima, fled into exile in Austria before returning to South Africa, where he served three years in prison before being pardoned. The Transkei Defence Force was dissolved in 1994 when Transkei was reincorporated into South Africa. Qaqambile Matanzima achieved the rank of colonel in the South African National Defence Force (SANDF) before leaving the military in 1996. Matanzima became the leader of the Mtshanyane Traditional Council, as well as a senior traditional leader, in 2000. He was also a member of the Eastern Cape House of Traditional Leaders from 2003 until his death in 2013. On August 5, 2013, Matanzima, who was en route to a meeting in Bhisho, picked up a man pretending to be a hitchhiker in Stutterheim, Eastern Cape. Matanzuma was stabbed by the man during an attempted carjacking and robbery, which took place on the N8 road approximately 10\u00a0km from Stutterheim. Qaqambile Matanzima was taken to hospital, where he died of his injuries the same day. He was survived by his wife, Nozolile, and five children.

        "prefix": "(\"Indies Neighborhood\") is a neighborhood in the borough of Oost, the eastern part of the city of Amsterdam, Netherlands. The name of the neighborhood dates",
        "reference": " from the early 20th century, and is derived from the fact that the neighborhood's streets are named after islands and other geographical concepts in the former Dutch colony of the Dutch East Indies or now known as Indonesia. The first street was named in 1902. In 2003, the neighborhood had around 23,000 inhabitants. The neighborhood is bounded on the west by the railroad Amsterdam - Hilversum (with the Muiderpoort Station), on the east side by Flevopark, on the north side by Zeeburgerdijk and on the south side by the Ringvaart Watergraafsmeer. Indische Buurt is the oldest part of the former Zeeburg district and is very ethnically diverse. A high percentage of the population is of immigrant origin (for Zeeburg this is already high at 55%, but higher in the Indische Buurt) and there are an estimated 100 languages spoken. The impetus was given to create a new residential area in the early 20th century, as Amsterdam had previously experienced large population growth. The construction of the area was well under way on the wave of economic growth that followed the completion of the North Sea Canal in 1876 and the commissioning of the Merwedekanaal in 1892. In May 1915, the tram route 14 was extended into Indische Buurt. The growth continued for some time, with an interruption in the 1930s as a result of the Great Depression. Indische Buurt was relatively isolated from the rest of the city by its position behind the railway line that runs through the area, and connects Amsterdam Centraal with Utrecht, until 1939 when Muiderpoort Station was built. One of the last bath houses in Amsterdam was built on Javaplein in 1942, which functioned until 1982. From the 1960s the Amsterdam seaport moved to the west of the city and the neighborhood became a purely residential area. Since the mid-1990s the area is undergoing rapid gentrification as formerly squatted buildings, as well as former student housing, are being renovated and sold. Timorplein is a particular area of focus for the area's urban gentrification, and the square's renewal was completed in 2010 with the opening of a new cultural institution which includes Studio K, housing a theater and restaurant, a new 'Stayokay' hostel, and the IIRE, which includes meeting and conference rooms. Another redevelopment project is 'Pompstation', near the Zeeburgerdijk tram stop, a restaurant and cafe located in a former industrial building. In addition, one of the neighborhoods's major thoroughfares, the Javastraat, has been transformed into a new Mediterranean-style shopping area which included the repaving of streets and improved bicycle parking. In 2010, the Borneohof building was constructed on the Javaplein, which houses a large library of Amsterdam, restaurants like Het Badhuis en de Wilde Zwijnen and the gym Akademia Training. Amsterdam Muiderpoort railway station is situated in the west of Indische Buurt on the border with Watergraafsmeer. Trains to Amsterdam, Schiphol, Rotterdam, Utrecht / Rhenen and Amersfoort call at Muiderpoort. Tram routes 3, 7 and 14 have their terminus in Indische Buurt. Route 3 has its terminus at the Muiderpoort Station, and routes 7 and 14 at Flevopark. Bus routes 22, 40, 41 all have a terminal at Muiderpoort Station. In addition, bus lines 37, and 65 run through Indische Buurt. Within Indische Buurt, several smaller areas are recognized: Ambonbuurt, Makassarbuurt, Sumatrabuurt and Timorbuurt. Ambonbuurt (Ambon neighborhood) is a densely populated residential area bounded by the Insulindeweg, Molukkenstraat, Valentijnkade and the railway line. The neighborhood has the second highest population density of the neighborhood after the neighboring Sumatrabuurt. The population in 2010 was approximately 4,000 people in an area of 16 hectares. Makassarbuurt (Makassar neighborhood) is primarily a residential neighborhood which lies in between Zeeburgerdijk, Molukkenstraat, Insulindeweg and Flevopark. The area covers 115 hectares, of which more than half is park and water. The area is densely populated and has 6,618 residents as at early 2010. The neighborhood's shopping areas include Molukkenstraat and the commercial zone around Zeeburgerdijk. On the east side of Indische Buurt is Flevopark, which includes the outdoor Flevopark swimming pools. This park was planned in 1908 by naturalist Jac. P. Thijsse, who envisioned a park between the Jewish Cemetery and the Nieuwe Diep. The expropriation procedure began in 1914, and from 1921 there was money available to obtain the land suitable for building the park. In 1928, the construction of the park began. Flevopark includes the site of a Jewish cemetery. It was in use since 1714 by the Jewish Community, and there are an estimated 200,000 people buried there. It has not been in active use anymore since 1942. Sumatrabuurt (The Sumatra Area) lies between Insulindeweg, Molukkenstraat and Valentijnkade. It is the most densely populated of all neighborhoods in the borough of Amsterdam-Oost. In 2010, about 3,000 people lived on an area of 14 hectares. A commercial area lies on the west side along Molukkenstraat. Timorbuurt lies between Zeeburgerdijk, Molukkenstraat, Insulindeweg and Celebesstraat. It is densely populated: the population in 2010 was approximately 8,000, giving a population density of 14,837 per km\u00b2. There are no parks in the area. The area contains the Timorplein, a cultural spot. Mostly a residential neighborhood, it contains the Javastraat, the Indische Buurt's most important shopping street.\n",

        "reference": "ters on Earth were turned on and off so that the capsule communicator (CapCom) could communicate with the crews of the spacecraft. It was a means of in-band signaling to simulate the action of the push-to-talk and release-to-listen (often referred to as PTT) button commonly found on two-way radio systems and walkie-talkies. When Mission Control (in Houston, Texas) wanted to talk to astronauts, the capsule communicator (CapCom) pushed a button (push-to-talk, or PTT) that turned on the transmitter, then spoke, then released the button. When the transmitter is local, this is easy to arrange - the transmitter is connected directly to the PTT button. But to stay in continuous contact with the astronauts as they orbit the Earth, or travel to the Moon, NASA had to use tracking stations all around the world, switching from one station to the next as needed. To get the voice signal to the remote transmitter, dedicated telephone lines connected these stations to Houston. NASA could either build a parallel system for operating the transmitters - one line to carry the audio and another to carry the control signal for the PTT button (out-of-band signalling), or combine these two systems together, using audio tones to turn the transmitter on and off. Since dedicated phone lines were a very expensive measure at the time, NASA chose the use of tones to reduce the operating cost of the network. The same system was used in Project Gemini and was still in use with half duplex UHF Space Shuttle communications for transmitter RF keying. With modern digital communication systems, Quindar tones are no longer necessary because a single communication line (such as a fiber optic cable) can simultaneously carry multiple communication channels in the form of data comprising both speech and signaling (the PTT signal), as well as video and telemetry. The Quindar system, named after its manufacturer, used two tones, both being pure sine waves that were 250ms long. The \"intro tone\" was generated at 2,525\u00a0Hz and signaled the \"key down\" key-press of the PTT button and unmuted the audio. The \"outro tone\" was slightly lower at 2,475\u00a0Hz and signalled the release of the PTT button and muted the audio. The two tones were generated by special equipment located at Mission Control, and they were decoded by detectors located at the various tracking stations. The selection of the tones allowed them to travel in the same passband as a human voice, which has a range from roughly 300\u00a0Hz to 3,000\u00a0Hz. Two common misconceptions surround Quindar tones. The first is that one tone came from Earth and the other from the transmitters used by the astronauts while in space. This confusion exists because many ground-to-space transmissions were initiated by Mission Control and responded to by the astronauts. In this sequence, the CapCom would press the PTT, which would send the intro tone, and then speak. When finished speaking, the CapCom would release the PTT, which would send the outro tone, and the astronauts would respond to Mission Control. Therefore, those transmissions would consist of a \"beep\" (PTT press) followed by Houston talking, then another \"beep\" (PTT release) and finally the voice of the astronauts. Another misconception about Quindar tones is that they were designed to signal the end of a transmission, similar to a courtesy tone used on many half-duplex radio repeaters. Although the astronauts may have secondarily used the Quindar outro tone to know when the CAPCOM had started/stopped speaking, no equivalent existed for Mission Control because the astronauts keyed their transmissions locally (inside the spacecraft) using either a PTT or VOX, neither of which required Quindar tones. Additionally, separate radio frequencies allowed both Houston and the astronauts to talk simultaneously if they wished and thereby made a courtesy tone as a way to minimize the possibility of both of them speaking at the same time unnecessary. Quindar tones were named for the manufacturer Quindar Electronics, Inc. Glen Swanson, historian at NASA's Johnson Space Center who edited the Mission Transcript Collection, and Steve Schindler, an engineer with voice systems engineering at NASA's Kennedy Space Center, confirmed the origin of the name. \"Quindar tones, named after the manufacturer of the tone generation and detection equipment, are actually used to turn on and off, or 'key', the remote transmitters at the various tracking stations\".\n",

        "reference": "SEAN Basketball League (ABL). Coming directly out of Thornwood High School in South Holland, Illinois, Curry was selected fourth overall in the 2001 NBA draft by the Chicago Bulls. Curry played for the Bulls until 2005, then played for the New York Knicks from 2005 to 2010. Curry played for the Miami Heat in the  season and was part of the Heat's 2012 championship team. Curry played for the Dallas Mavericks for the early part of the  season before playing out the season for the Zhejiang Golden Bulls of the Chinese Basketball Association. Prior to becoming considered one of the best high school basketball players in the nation as a senior at Thornwood High School in South Holland, Illinois, Curry aspired to be a gymnast and did not pick up basketball until the seventh grade when he reluctantly went out for the school team. In 2001, Curry led his team to second place in the IHSA State Playoffs. For his efforts, Curry was named 2001 Illinois Mr. Basketball. In his senior year of high school he posted averages of 22 points per game, 9 rebounds and 6 blocks. He was named to the 1998, 1999 and 2000 State Farm Holiday Classic all-tournament teams, and in 2003 was named by the fans to the tournament's All-Quarter Century Team. Curry had signed a letter of intent to play at DePaul University but declared himself eligible for the 2001 NBA Draft in which the Chicago Bulls made him the fourth overall pick. Curry's contribution was limited during his rookie year due to limited minutes. Curry improved in his second year, leading the NBA in field goal percentage (58. 5%) and becoming the first Bull to lead the league in a major statistical category since Michael Jordan in 1998. In the 2004\u201305 season the Bulls improved by 28 wins and made the playoffs as the 22-year-old Curry led the team in scoring before being hospitalized with an irregular heartbeat. This caused him to miss the last 13 games of the regular season and the entire playoffs. On June 24, 2005, heart specialists cleared Curry to resume practice. On October 3, 2005, after refusing on privacy grounds to submit to a DNA test, as requested by Bulls management, to assess whether he has a congenital heart condition, Curry was traded to the New York Knicks. The trade included the Bulls' Antonio Davis, as well as the Knicks' Mike Sweetney, Tim Thomas, and Jermaine Jackson. First-round draft picks were also exchanged in the trade\u2014which later came back to haunt the Knicks as they had a poor 2005\u201306 season in which Curry averaged 13. 6 points and 6. 0 rebounds per game (numbers that were significantly down from the previous season). Curry's inability to defend and rebound was a source of frustration for former coaches Scott Skiles and Larry Brown. When asked by a reporter in 2003 what Curry needed to do to become a better rebounder, Skiles simply replied: \"Jump\". The 2006\u201307 season saw a resurgence in Curry's performance under new coach Isiah Thomas, with Curry anointed the team's primary offensive option, averaging career highs in points (19. 6), rebounds (7. 1), and minutes (34. 9) per game. On April 7, 2007 Curry scored a career-best 43 points in an overtime win over the Milwaukee Bucks; his first three-pointer of the season forcing the game into the extra period. Curry is 2 for 2 (100%) from three-point range in his NBA career. In the 2007\u20132008 season, Curry was expected to form a great frontcourt with Zach Randolph, however both of them saw a regression in their games. Curry showed up to training camp in October 2008 out of shape for the second year in a row, incensing new head coach Mike D'Antoni. Curry not only lost his starting job, but was not even in D'Antoni's rotation at the beginning of the 2008\u20132009 season. Curry was also bothered by a sore right knee for much of the season. Curry played his first game of the season on January 8, 2009 against the Dallas Mavericks and played in two other games later in the season. During the 2009 off-season Curry began working with a trainer on a fitness and weight-loss regimen. As of mid-July he had lost 30 pounds, but according to the trainer it would be \"delusional\" for coaches to think he could get down to his listed weight of 285 pounds. On February 22, 2011, Curry was traded to the Minnesota Timberwolves in a three-way blockbuster deal which also involved Denver Nuggets that brought Carmelo Anthony to New York. On March 1, 2011, his contract was bought out by the Timberwolves before he played a single game for them, making him a free agent. On December 10, 2011, Curry signed a one-year contract with the Miami Heat. On January 19, 2012, a noticeably-slimmer Curry played in the NBA for the first time since 2009, against the Los Angeles Lakers. He had lost nearly 70 pounds since he last played in the NBA, and scored six points in six minutes in his return to the NBA. As a part of the Heat's 2011-2012 championship team, Curry played 83 minutes in 14 games (starting one), and was active for (but did not play in) one game during the playoffs. In October 2012, Curry signed with the San Antonio Spurs. However, he did not make the team's final roster. Curry was claimed off waivers by the Dallas Mavericks on October 25, 2012. He played two games for Dallas before being waived to make room for Troy Murphy, as the Mavericks wanted a power forward with outside shooting ability instead of a traditional center. In December 6, 2012, Curry signed with the Zhejiang Golden Bulls in China, replacing Josh Boone. Curry played in 29 games and averaged 23. 0 points, 10. 1 rebounds, and 0. 9 assists per game. Curry played his last game with Zhejiang on February 27, 2013, as he missed the last two playoff games due to gastroenteritis. Curry signed with the Zhuhai Wolf Warriors of the ASEAN Basketball League (ABL) in 2018, and played for the team in 2018\u201319 ABL season. Curry is married and has seven children, one from a previous marriage (Eddy III), and four with his current wife Patrice Curry, who starred on VH1's Basketball Wives LA franchise. Curry's other two children, Ava and Noah, were with former girlfriend Nova Henry, who was murdered in 2009 along with 10-month-old Ava. Several prominent cardiologists cleared Curry to play, but Barry Maron, a world-renowned specialist in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, suggested a DNA test. During the team's media day, Bulls General Manager John Paxson said he understood the privacy issues involved but insisted the Bulls did not have an ulterior motive, that their concern was a situation similar to those of former Boston Celtics guard Reggie Lewis or Loyola Marymount star Hank Gathers\u2014players with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy who collapsed and died\u2014and that the Bulls had offered Curry an annuity of $400,000 per year for 50 years if he took and failed the genetic test. Curry never took the test and ultimately continued his career based on the clearances from other experts. On January 12, 2009, Curry was sued by his former chauffeur, David Kuchinsky. Kuchinsky accused Curry of trying to solicit sex from him. According to court papers, Curry twice approached Kuchinsky \"in the nude,\" saying, \"Look at me, Dave, look\" and, \"Come and touch it, Dave\". Kuchinsky also alleged that Curry called him racial slurs. Kuchinsky claimed Curry owed him $68,000 in unpaid wages, as well as $25,000 in expenses which Curry never repaid. Those expenses, he said, included cellphones that Curry had him buy as gifts and hotel and club bills. Curry's lawyer, Kelly A. Saindon, called Kuchinsky's claims \"preposterous\" and \"extortion\". Federal judge Denise Cote dismissed the lawsuit on May 28, 2009 and sent it to arbitration. Curry's ex-girlfriend, Nova Henry, and their ten-month-old daughter Ava Curry were found murdered in Chicago on January 24, 2009. A paternity test proved that Ava was the daughter of Curry and Henry. Their three-year-old son Noah was found unharmed at the scene. Two counts of first degree murder were brought against 36-year-old attorney Frederick Goings on February 22, 2009; Goings had served as Henry's attorney in a custody case against Curry involving Ava, and was allegedly involved in a relationship with Henry. Goings was convicted of all charges against him on February 12, 2013. As of June 2009, Curry's Chicago home was in foreclosure; he owed close to $220,000 in mortgage payments. Curry took out a nearly $4 million mortgage on the property in 2006, which included monthly house payments of more than $25,000. Led Thornwood High School to the Illinois State Championship game, averaging 22. 0 points, 9. 0 rebounds and 6. 0 blocked shots, shooting. 640 from the floor, including 25. 0 points and 10. 0 rebounds in the state tournament. Averaged 24. 6 points and 11. 2 rebounds, along with 4. 8 blocks, as a junior.

Besides athletics, Barthel also led successful careers in both chemistry and politics. Born in Mamer, Josy Barthel's abilities as a middle-distance runner was discovered during World War II. His first fame came by winning the 800 m at the Military World Championships in Berlin in 1947. At the 1948 Summer Olympics in London, Barthel finished ninth at the 1500 m final. Then he won Student World Championships in 1949 (1500 m) and 1951 (800 m and 1500 m). The absolute high point of Barthel's career was the 1952 Summer Olympics, where he surprised the crowd and himself by winning the 1500 m with a very strong finish. He also participated at the 1956 Summer Olympics, after which he retired from running. He was also Luxembourg champion in 800 m and 1500 m from 1946 to 1956. In 1962 Barthel became the president of the Luxembourg Athletics Federation, then from 1973 to 1977 he was the president of the Luxembourgish Olympic and Sporting Committee. He was also member of the Luxembourg government from 1977 to 1984. Josy Barthel died in Luxembourg City after a severe illness. The national stadium of Luxembourg, home to the Luxembourg national football team, was named Stade Josy Barthel in his honor. The Lyc\u00e9e Technique Josy Barthel in Mamer also bears his name. In 2006, Barthel was accused of doping by sports journalist Erik Eggers in the German newspaper Der Tagesspiegel. Eggers cited German physician Oskar Wegener who did research on methamphetamine and other doping substances in the 1950s. Wegener strongly denied saying Barthel had any connection with doping. The use of such substances was neither prohibited nor controlled until the 1960s.\n",

By the 1920s, a local film industry was started and in the 1930s, the Thai film industry had its first \"golden age\", with a number of studios producing films. The years after the Second World War saw a resurgence of the industry, which used 16 mm film to produce hundreds of films, many of them hard-driving action films. Competition from Hollywood brought the Thai industry to a low point in the 1980s and 1990s, but by the end of the 1990s, Thailand had its \"new wave\", with such directors as Nonzee Nimibutr, Pen-Ek Ratanaruang and Apichatpong Weerasethakul, as well as action hero Tony Jaa, being celebrated at film festivals around the world. Auguste and Louis Lumi\u00e8re had a film exhibition that toured in Southeast Asia in 1894, and on 9 June 1897, \"the wonderful Parisian cinematograph\" was screened in Bangkok, and is the first known film screening in Thailand. That same year, the film of the visit to Europe by King Chulalongkorn was brought back to Thailand, along with camera equipment acquired by the king's brother, Prince Thongthaem Sambassatra. () The prince, considered \"the father of Thai cinema\", made many films and his work was shown commercially. Japanese businessmen opened the first permanent cinema, the Japanese Cinematograph, in 1905. Japanese films were so popular that nang yipun became the generic term for all moving pictures. European and American films were called nang farang (after the nang drama (shadow puppet plays) that were a Thai traditional art). Under another member of the royal family, Prince Kamphangphet, the Topical Film Service of the State Railway of Thailand was set up. The service produced many promotional documentaries for the railroad and other government agencies and became an important training ground for many filmmakers. Sam Poi Luang: Great Celebration in the North (Thai: \u0e2a\u0e32\u0e21\u0e1b\u0e2d\u0e22\u0e2b\u0e25\u0e27\u0e07), a docudrama that became a hit when it was released in 1940. Another of the first Thai films was Nang Sao Suwan, or Miss Suwanna of Siam, a Hollywood co-production with the Topical Film Service that was directed and scripted by Henry MacRae. It premiered on 22 June 1923, in Bangkok at the Phathanakorn Cinematograph. Unfortunately, Miss Suwanna has been lost over the years, with only a few still photos from it remaining. The first all-Thai feature was Chok Sorng Chan (Double Luck), produced by the Wasuwat brothers' Bangkok Film Company in 1927 and directed by Manit Wasuwat (Thai: \u0e21\u0e32\u0e19\u0e34\u0e15 \u0e27\u0e2a\u0e38\u0e27\u0e31\u0e15). That same year, a film company, Tai Phapphayon Thai Company, produced Mai Khit Loei (Unexpected). Seventeen films were made between 1927 and 1932, but only fragments have survived, such as a one-minute car chase from Chok Song Chan or a two- to three-minute boxing match from Khrai Di Khrai Dai (None But the Brave). Hollywood would also make movies in Siam during this time, including the documentary, Chang, by Merian C. Cooper and Ernest B. Schoedsack, about a poor farmer struggling to carve out a living in the jungle. In making the film, they were assisted by Prince Yugala Dighambara, grandfather of modern-day filmmaker Prince Chatrichalerm Yukol. Robert Kerr, who served as assistant director to Henry MacRae on Miss Suwanna returned to Siam in 1928 to direct his own film, The White Rose. It was shown in Bangkok in September 1928. By 1928, the first \"talkies\" were being imported, providing some heavy competition for the silent Thai films. In the tradition of the benshi in Japan, local cinemas had entertaining narrators to introduce the films as well as traditional Thai orchestras that were often as big an audience pleaser as the films themselves, and but within two or three years, silent movies had given way to the talkies. The first Thai sound film was Long Thang (Gone Astray), produced by the Wasuwat brothers, and premiered on 1 April 1932. Considered an ideological film in the period of political reform, the film proved a big success and led to the building of the Sri Krung Talkie Film Company in Bang Kapi. It produced three to four films a year. In 1933, Sri Krung made the first colour Thai film, Grandpa Som's Treasure (Pu Som Fao Sap). This period up until 1942 is regarded by scholars as the \"Golden Age\" for Thai film. Among the hit films of this period was the 1938 musical, Klua Mia (Wife-phobia) by the Srikrung studio. It was shot on 35-mm colour stock. The stars were Chamras Suwakhon and Manee Sumonnat, the first Thai actors to be recognized as movie stars by having their names painted on their chairs while filming at the studio. As the Second World War loomed, and the country being led by a dictatorship under Field Marshal Plaek Pibulsonggram film companies were pressed into service to make propaganda films to whip up nationalism. Opposition politics found their way into film, too, with statesman Pridi Phanomyong producing King of the White Elephant, in 1940. With all the dialogue in English, Pridi hoped to send a message to the outside world that he was unhappy with the militaristic direction his country was taking. The film depicts the story of an ancient Siamese king who only goes to war after he's been attacked. The advent of sound raised another problem for cinemas in Thailand: the language of the talkies. Soon a dubbing method developed in which a dubber would provide a simultaneous translation of the dialogue by speaking Thai into a microphone at the back of the theater. The first Thai dubber was Sin Sibunruang, or \"Tit Khiaw\", who had worked for Siam Film Company and was the editor of the company's film magazine. Tit Khiaw and other talented dubbers became stars in their own right. They would perform all the roles in the films, both male and female, as well as such sound effects as animal noises, cars and gunfire. Also, there were film companies that could not afford to make sound films, and would make films with the intention that they would be dubbed at screenings by live performers reading from a script. These dubbed films proved as popular as the talkies, especially if the dubber was well known. Due to the extensive use of 16 mm film in the 1970s, the technique has lasted up until recent years, especially for outdoor screenings of films at temple fairs in rural areas. Examples of a dubber at work can be seen in contemporary Thai films, Monrak Transistor (2000) and Bangkok Loco (2004). After the end of the Second World War, filmmaking got under way again in Thailand using surplus 16 mm black-and-white stock from wartime newsreel production. At least two Thai films were produced in 1946. One was an action film, Chai Chatree (Brave Men), directed by journalist-turned-filmmaker Chalerm Sawetanant. The screenplay was by writer Malai Chupinij, who would go on to script other films of the era, including Chao Fah Din Salai (Till Death Do Us Part). The other film noted by the National Film Archive for 1946 was an adaptation of a Thai folktale, Chon Kawao (The Village of Chon Kawao). The post-war boom in filmmaking really took off, however, with the use of 16-mm colour-reversal film, which was easy to obtain and make films with. The vividly coloured films were popular with audiences as well, prompting dozens of new filmmakers to enter the business. Similar to the dubbing of films during the pre-war years, some of these films used dubbers to provide dialogue and sound effects as the film was running, further adding to the entertainment value of the movies. From 1947 until 1972, 16\u00a0mm was the industry standard for Thai film production. The first hit of the era was 1949's Suparb Burut Sua Thai (Thai Gentlemen Fighters), which outgrossed Hollywood films at the local box office. That success prompted more enthusiasm for filmmaking, giving rise to the second \"golden age\" of Thai cinema. At the height of the 16-mm era, cinematographer and director Rattana Pestonji sought to use 35 mm film and generally improve the artistic quality of Thai films. Most of his films are regarded today as masterpieces, including Santi-Weena, which was the first Thai film to be entered into international competition, at the 1954 Asia Pacific Film Festival in Tokyo, and 1961's Black Silk, the first Thai film in competition at the Berlin International Film Festival. Though Rattana made relatively few films, he worked tirelessly to promote the industry, and died in 1970 as he was to make a speech to government officials about setting up a national film agency. Thailand saw an explosion of locally produced films during the 1970s after the Thai government imposed a heavy tax on imported films in 1977, which led to a boycott of Thailand by Hollywood studios. To pick up the slack, 150 Thai films were made in 1978 alone. Many of these films were low-grade action films and were derided by critics and scholars as \"nam nao\" or \"stinking water\". But socially conscious films were being made as well, especially by Prince Chatrichalerm Yukol, a US-educated filmmaker and member of the Thai Royal Family, whose own family had been involved with filmmaking since the industry started in Thailand. Among Chatrichalerm's films during the 1970s was Khao Chue Karn (Dr. Karn), which addressed corruption in the Thai civil service and was nearly banned by the military-dominated regime of Thanom Kittikachorn. Chatrichalerm also made Hotel Angel (Thep Thida Rong Raem), about a young woman trapped into a life of prostitution. He made dozens of films along these socially conscious lines through the 1990s, working up to his lavish historical epic, The Legend of Suriyothai in 2001. Another filmmaker active during this time was Vichit Kounavudhi, who made his share of action films as well as more socially conscious works like First Wife, about the custom of men taking \"second wives\" or \"mia noi\" \u2013 a euphemism for mistress. Vichit also made Her Name is Boonrawd (1985), about prostitution around an American military airbase during the Vietnam War. Vichit's best known works are two semi-documentary films, Mountain People (Khon Phukao), an adventure tale about a young hill-tribe couple, and Look Isan (Son of the Northeast), about a family of subsistence farmers in 1930s Isan. Also in 1985, director Euthana Mukdasanit made Pee Seua lae Dawkmai (Butterfly and Flowers), highlighting hardships along the Southern Thailand border. Not only did the film help expose urban Thais to regional poverty, the film broke new ground in its portrayal of a Buddhist-Muslim relationship. It won the Best Film award at the Hawaii International Film Festival. By 1981, Hollywood studios were once again sending films to Thailand. Also, television (see also Media in Thailand) was a growing part of Thai culture. This was a low period for the Thai film industry, and by the mid-1990s, studio output was averaging about 10 films per year. In the wake of the Asian financial crisis in 1997, three directors of television commercials \u2013 Nonzee Nimibutr, Pen-Ek Ratanaruang and Wisit Sasanatieng \u2013 were thinking that films needed to be more artistic to attract investors and audiences. The first breakthrough was in 1997, with Nonzee's crime drama, Dang Bireley's and Young Gangsters (2499 Antapan Krong Muang), which earned a record box office take of more than 75 million baht. Also in 1997, Pen-Ek's crime comedy, Fun Bar Karaoke, was selected to play at the Berlin Film Festival \u2013 the first time in twenty years that Thai cinema had had any kind of an international presence. Nonzee's next film, the ghost story Nang Nak, was an even bigger success, earning 149. 6 million baht \u2013 the highest-grossing film at the time. Wisit, who wrote screenplays for Dang Bireley's and Nang Nak, broke out with Tears of the Black Tiger, a super-stylised western homage to the Thai action films of the 1960s and '70s. It was the first film to be included on the programme at the Cannes Film Festival. There were also the Pang Brothers from Hong Kong, who came to Thailand to make stylish movies, starting with Bangkok Dangerous and the nod to J-Horror, The Eye. With the New Wave directors achieving commercial and artistic success, a new crop of filmmakers has grown up outside the traditional and often restrictive Thai studio system to create experimental short films and features. The leader of this indie movement is Apichatpong Weerasethakul, whose 2002 feature Blissfully Yours won the Un Certain Regard Prize at the Cannes Film Festival. Featuring a risqu\u00e9 sex scene involving a Burmese man and a Thai woman in the jungle, the movie received only limited screenings in Thailand and a Thai-released DVD of the film was censored. Apichatpong's next film, Tropical Malady, featuring a gay romance between an army soldier and a country guy, was a jury-prize winner at Cannes. It, too, only received limited screenings in Thailand. Other indie directors include Aditya Assarat (Wonderful Town), Anocha Suwichakornpong (Mundane History), Pimpaka Towira (One Night Husband), Thunska Pansittivorakul (Voodoo Girls), Sivaroj Kongsakul (Eternity), Wichanon Somumjarn (In April the Following Year, There Was a Fire) and Nawapol Thamrongrattanarit (36). All films, VCDs and DVDs are placed under scrutiny of a censorship board. Until 2009, films were regulated by the Film Act of 1930. The first board of censors included both men and women and was drawn from the ranks of aristocracy, the civil service and the police. Each film passed by the censors had to include a stamp on each reel, and each item of printed advertising had to contain the stamp, too. The National Police was responsible for screening films and videos until September 2005, when the government's Ministry of Culture took over the function. Every VCD and DVD sold for home viewing must bear a stamp that it has passed the Censorship Board. On some VCDs and DVDs produced in Thailand, the censors sometimes take a hard line against depictions of nudity, sex, smoking, the presence of alcohol and guns being pointed at people, images that are forbidden on broadcast television. In other instances, violent acts might pass through uncut, but sex and nudity will be edited out. Before the digital age, scissors and petroleum jelly were the tools of the trade for censors. Today the offending images are blurred out electronically. The effect of pixelization is so pervasive that the practice has been satirised in films, including 2004's action comedy, Jaew or M.A.I.D., as well as the zombie comedy, SARS Wars. Imported DVDs are generally not altered by the Thai authorities, though the Ministry of Culture's watchdogs do ban items, or at least strongly encourage retailers to not carry them. From the time the Ministry of Culture took over the censorship board until March 2006, about 40 VCD or DVD titles were banned, though a list of the banned items was not made available. In 2007, the independent film, Syndromes and a Century was to undergo cuts before public release in Thailand. The censors objected to depictions of a Buddhist monk playing guitar, a physician kissing his girlfriend, some doctors drinking whisky in a hospital conference room and some monks playing with a remote-control flying saucer. Director Apichatpong Weerasethakul would not make the cuts and withdrew his film from release in Thailand. It had previously screened in other countries uncut. After the controversy over Syndromes and a Century, the Free Thai Cinema Movement started to gain momentum in late April 2007. A petition signed by artists and scholars was submitted to the National Legislative Assembly, which was considering a new motion picture ratings system. The proposed system, passed by the military-appointed National Legislative Assembly proved controversial as well, as it would not imposes ratings structure but also keeps censorship in place. The 1930 Film Act was replaced in 2009 by a film-ratings system. The ratings system has six classifications \u2013 G for general audiences, P for \"promote\" as educational, 13+, 15+ and 18+ suggested viewing ages and the restricted 20- rating, which requires ID checks at the cinemas. A hidden seventh tier of the system is an outright ban by the Film and Video sub-committee. Action films are a predominant genre of Thai film. During the 1960s and '70s, when Mitr Chaibancha and Sombat Metanee were the leading action heroes, hundreds of hard-hitting, explosive features were made. In recent years, the martial arts films starring Tony Jaa, Ong-Bak: Muay Thai Warrior and Tom-Yum-Goong, have put Thai action films on the international map. Kerd ma lui (Born to Fight) is in the same vein, and gives more exposure to action choreographer Panna Rittikrai, who toiled for decades making low-budget, direct-to-video action films featuring dangerous stunt choreography. The culture of Thailand's B-movie stuntmen is further examined in the 2005 documentary, Crying Tigers, by Santi Taepanich. Action comedies have also proven to be popular, including 2001's Killer Tattoo by Yuthlert Sippapak, who cast well-known Thai comedians, including Petchtai Wongkamlao and Suthep Po-ngam, in roles as bumbling hitmen. Thai animation got underway after the Second World War, when artist Sanae Klaikluen was asked by the Thai government to make a short animated cartoon that instructed Thai citizens to wear hats and farmers to wear boots. Sanae in turn influenced Payut Ngaokrachang, who made a 1955 short about a traffic cop called Haed Mahasajan. Payut went on to make Thailand's first and only cel-animated feature film, The Adventure of Sudsakorn, in 1979. Because of the labour-intensive work involved with animation, it was cheaper for studios to make live-action films, so animation was eschewed. But in recent years, Thailand's technology community has sought to make the country a hub for computer animation, with many animated television shows, commercials and video games being created in Thailand. In 2006, Thailand's first computer-animated feature film was released, Khan Khluay, about King Naresuan the Great's war elephant. It is directed by Kompin Kemgunerd, on such Disney features as Atlantis: The Lost Empire and Tarzan and Blue Sky Studios' Ice Age. Although the work is being done on computers, Kompin has faced many of the same difficulties in funding and human resources that Payut faced. No matter what the genre of Thai film, most films \u2013 be they action, horror or romantic dramas \u2013 have some element of comedy. One of the classic comedies from the 1960s is called Ngern Ngern Ngern (Money, Money, Money). It starred Mitr Chaibancha and Petchara Chaowarat in a story about the nephew of an unscrupulous moneylender who takes sides with a group of debtors against his uncle. The remake of the film was done in the 1980s. In 2005, the comedy Luang phii theng (The Holy Man) starring comedian Pongsak Pongsuwan as a street hood who poses as a Buddhist monk, was one of the top films at the domestic box office. Most of the films by Pen-Ek Ratanaruang have been crime films, from his debut feature 1997's Fun Bar Karaoke to 2006's Invisible Waves. A true-crime film, 2003's Macabre Case of Prom Pirom (Keunbab prompiram) by veteran director Manop Udomdej, about a 1977 murder-rape of a young woman in a rural village was controversial because the village where the case took place did not want the incident revisited. The film played at many overseas festivals, including the New York Asian Film Festival. Another true-crime case about a cannibalistic serial killer in 1946 Bangkok was depicted in the 2004 film Zee-Oui. Kathoey (transgender people) or gay people are often featured as comic relief or villains in mainstream Thai films, but there have been a number of films that make gay people and kathoey the main characters. Transgender people and gay people are also known as \"tdoot\", originated from the title of the 1982 American film Tootsie. One of the first was Youngyooth Thongkonthun's Iron Ladies, or Satree lek, based on a true story about a transgender gay men's volleyball team that won a national championship in 1996. It was a huge hit on the international festival circuit. The 2000 comedy spawned a sequel in 2003, The Iron Ladies 2 (Satree lek 2). More loosely based on a true incident was the 2002 film Saving Private Tootsie, which tells the story of a group of gay and kathoey entertainers who are lost in rebel-held jungle territory after their plane crashes. A squad from the Thai army, led by a gruff, homophobic sergeant played by veteran actor Sorapong Chatree, goes to the rescue. And the life of transgender Muay Thai champion Parinya Kiatbusaba (or Nong Tum) is related in 2003's Beautiful Boxer, directed by Ekachai Uekorngtham. Unlike The Iron Ladies, Beautiful Boxer was less comedic in tone. The 2003 film Tropical Malady, directed by Apichatpong Weerasethakul, depicts a romance between a Thai army soldier and a local small-town boy. The narrative of the film then abruptly shifts in the middle to relate a folk tale about a tiger shaman, with the soldier alone in the jungle, haunted by the tiger-shaman's spirit. The film won a jury prize at the Cannes Film Festival. Apichatpong also co-directed the low-budget digital movie, The Adventure of Iron Pussy, with artist Michael Shaowanasai, who portrays a transgender secret agent. A musical, the movie also was an homage and a parody of the Thai films of the 1960s and '70s, with Shaowansai basing his character on the actress Petchara Chaowarat. In 2005, Thai film Rainbow Boys, depicting a contemporary gay relationship, produced by Vitaya Saeng-aroon, saw a limited-release screening. Vitaya also produced the comedy-drama Club M2, set in a gay sauna. And in 2006 there was The Last Song, a remake of a 1985 Thai film about a transsexual cabaret dancer and her struggle to find acceptance and true love. Me. Myself ( or Kaw hai rak jong jaroen) is a 2007 Thai romantic drama film written and directed by actor-singer Pongpat Wachirabunjong. In the film, Ananda Everingham stars as a male dancer in a drag cabaret who must re-find himself after being struck by a car and suffering from amnesia. Another 2007 film, Bangkok Love Story, directed by Poj Arnon, was critically hailed as a departure from the stereotyped view of homosexuals as transvestites. Gay Thai independent film producer similarly praised the film, saying director Poj Arnon was \"brave enough to shake society up\". In 2011, Thanwarin Sukhaphisit's Insects in the Backyard, a movie depicting the struggles of a family in which a transgender teenage son and daughter's lives are tormented by a lack of communication and an inability to communicate with their biological father to the point that they end up selling their bodies looking, very much in vain, for a way out of their own lives, became the first film to receive the Haw Heep rating, which banned the distribution and showing of the film. There is one scene which the national board of film reviewers deemed to be pornographic in nature and therefore determined in an impediment to national order. In 2012, Thanwarin's It Gets Better is marketed to a more mainstream audience, and was admitted by the film committee. The film portrays the story of a young boy whose father forces him to become a monk after he catches him wearing his mother's clothes and dancing around effeminately in his room. At first the boy resists, but is then captivated by the beauty of the monk who comes out of the temple, and so immediately changes his mind. The story runs alongside two other narratives, one of a man returned to Thailand to sell his father's business and the other of a woman whose purpose seems unclear throughout the story until the very end. We find out that the monk is the woman, who has come back to see her father but is killed by a thief before she can make amends with him. It turns out the bar/dance club was hers and her death is the reason for her son's return to Thailand; his father's identity was kept from him his whole life, but after he learns everything from his biological father's office, he goes to see his grandfather and the story ends. Another staple of the Thai film industry, among the biggest was 2003's The Legend of Suriyothai by Chatrichalerm Yukol, who had done research for many years to write the screenplay. With a huge budget, support from the royal family and the cooperation across the nation's film industry, this film is considered a true \"national film\". A follow-up epic is 2007's King Naresuan, about 16th century ruler King Naresuan the Great, which topped the budget for Suriyothai, and was shown in two parts. Other epics include Bang Rajan by Thanit Jitnukul, who has made several other historical battle epics, including Sema: Warrior of Ayutthaya and Kun Pan: Legend of the Warlord. More recent history is depicted in The Overture, covering the life of a palace musician from the late 19th century to the 1940s, and The Tin Mine, set at a mine in southern Thailand in the 1950s. Many of the Thai early horror movies such as 1958 Mae Nak Phra Khanong and  1973 movie Krasue Sao (Ghosts of Guts Eater),, featured Mae Nak and Krasue, ancient village ghosts of Thai folklore that became very popular. Nonzee Nimibutr's Nang Nak in 1999 was a ghost story based on the same folkloric theme that had been depicted dozens of times throughout the history of Thai cinema and television. But it gave rise to a new crop of Thai horror and suspense films, including the Pang Brothers' The Eye, Nonzee's pan-Asian compilation Three, Bangkok Haunted, directed by Pisuth Praesaeng-Iam and Oxide Pang and the 2004 box-office smash Shutter by Banjong Pisonthanakun and Parkpoom Wongpoom. In 2013, Pee Mak Phra Khanong - another spin-off from Mae Nak folklore - became an instant hit throughout Southeast Asia, earning more than \u0e3f 1 Billion. Pee Mak is currently the highest grossing Thai film in the history of Thai cinema. Examples of slasher movies include Art of the Devil and a 2005 sequel (Long khong), as well as Scared and Narok (Hell), also in 2005. The horror genre also has spawned a number of genre-blending horror comedies, most notably the films of Yuthlert Sippapak, Buppah Rahtree (featured at the Toronto International Film Festival) and a sequel, and Krasue Valentine. There has even been a zombie movie, 2004's SARS Wars. The biggest hit musical was 1970's Monrak luk thung (Magical Love in the Countryside), starring Mitr Chaibancha and Petchara Chaowarat. It was hugely popular, playing in cinemas for six months. As a result, a whole genre of luk thung musicals, rhapsodizing Thailand's rural life in Isan was created. Another example was Dokdin Kanyamarn's 1971 musical comedy, Ai Tui (Mr. Tui), which starred Sombat Metanee and Petchara. In 2001 there were two movies that celebrated luk thung, the singing-contest comedy Monpleng Luk Thung FM (Hoedown Showdown) and Pen-Ek Ratanaruang's, Monrak Transistor, which paid tribute to the music of Suraphol Sombatcharoen. And in 2005, comedian-actor-director Petchtai Wongkamlao wrote, directed and starred in Yam Yasothon, a colourful homage to the 1970s musicals. It was one of top films at the Thai box office. Weepy, sentimental romance stories are audience favorites. Historically, Cherd Songsri's 1970s film Plae Chow (The Old Scar) is a classic tale of star-crossed lovers, and was one of the first Thai films to be a success internationally. During the 1980s, Baan Sai Thong based on the novel Kor Surangkanang was a popular hit. More recent examples include The Letter, in which tissues were actually handed out at the cinemas. Childhood romance was a hit with 2003's Fan Chan, which was made by six directors. One of the six, Komgrit Treewimol, went on to make the college-age romance, Dear Dakanda, a hit in 2005, but took three years to completely write, cast, film, and tweak. As a genre, teen films arose in the 1970s, with director Piak Poster's Wai Ounlawon, about a young man whose courtship of a teenaged girl puts him at odds with the girl's irascible father. That young couple, portrayed by the original actors, were revisited 30 years later as embattled parents in the 2005 sequel, Wai Ounlawon 4 (Oops. There's Dad). Music was an important component of the teen films, with a musical interlude featured prominently in the film and a soundtrack album that would be a popular hit. This was the case with both Wai Ounlawon and its recent sequel. Another noteworthy film of this genre is Fake, which was the debut film by Thanakorn Pongsuwan. The film's modern, visual style offers a sharp-focus snapshot of the city of Bangkok and a plausible account of the mating game in its current forms. In the burgeoning independent film movement, many short films are being produced and featured in festivals. Graceland, a film by Anocha Suwichakornpong, about an Elvis impersonator, was featured in the Cin\u00e9fondation competition at the 2006 Cannes Film Festival. It was the first Thai short film selected at Cannes. Short-film festivals in Thailand include the Thai Short Film and Video Festival by the Thai Film Foundation and the Fat Film Festival by Fat Radio. Thai short-film programs are also put together for the Bangkok International Film Festival and the World Film Festival of Bangkok. for the past two years CNXWOOD Studios has co-sponsor a Film Festival, in the northern city of Chiang Mai in conjunction with Creative Kingdom Animation Studios Film. Pen-ek Ratanaruang's Twelve Twenty (30 min) was made as part of the Digital Short Films by Three Filmmakers project for the 2006 Jeonju International Film Festival. The film stars Ananda Everingham, has an appearance by American bilingual actor Erich Fleshman, and was shot by Christopher Doyle. The short film is shot in a minimalist style and slowly moves along the encounters of a man and a woman on a long-haul flight, where they spend the next 12 hours and 20 minutes reading, drinking, eating and watching movies and sleeping by each other's side without talking. The Thai Short Film and Video Festival was first held in 1997. The Bangkok Film Festival was started in 1998, and was eventually supplanted by the Bangkok International Film Festival, which started in 2002 and is organized by the Tourism Authority of Thailand. The World Film Festival of Bangkok, sponsored by the Nation Multimedia Group, began in 2003, and it is held annually in October. In 2007, Digital Forum was begun in Bangkok as an outgrowth of the Thai Short Film and Video Festival, to showcase feature-length independent digital-video productions. Also in 2007, the inaugural Phuket Film Festival was held. In 2008, the annual Phangan Film Festival (PFF) was established on Koh Phangan, with a focus on spiritual and environmental indie films from around the world. In 2009, PFF's sister event, the annual Samui Film Festival (SFF) took place for the first time on Koh Samui. The first film awards in Thailand were the \"Golden Doll\" awards given by Tukata Tong magazine. The awards were first given in 1957. The statuette at first was a Thai classical dancer and later it was modelled after Phra Suratsawadi, the Thai-Hindu god of art. King Bhumibol Adulyadej handed out the awards in 1965 and '66. The Tukata Tong awards were discontinued after eight years due to organizational problems, but were revived in 1974 by the Association of Entertainment News Journalists of Thailand. The Thailand National Film Association Awards are organised by the National Federation of Motion Pictures and Contents Associations. The name of the award is the Subhanahongsa Award.

The Belfast Metropolitan Area dominates in population terms, with over a third of the inhabitants of Northern Ireland.

This is both because of historic links with Scotland going back centuries, and because of settlements of lowland Scots Protestants in Ulster in the 17th century, such as the Plantation of Ulster. Also unlike the Republic, a large proportion of people in Northern Ireland have a British national identity. Many people in Northern Ireland have a Northern Irish identity, whether in addition to a British or Irish identity or by itself. In 2001, 91. 0% of the population were born in Northern Ireland, 7. 2% were born in other parts of the UK and Ireland, and 1. 8% were born elsewhere. By 2011, the proportion of immigrants from outside the UK and Ireland had risen to 4. 3%, while the proportion born within them (outside Northern Ireland) had fallen to 6. 7%. The highest number of non-British/Irish immigrants are in Belfast, followed by Craigavon Urban Area and Dungannon.

        "prefix": "The German Empire () was a short-lived nation state which existed from 1848 to 1849. The state was created by the Frankfurt Parliament in spring 1848",
        "reference": ", following the March Revolution. The empire officially ended when the German Confederation was fully reconstituted in the Summer of 1851, but came to a de facto end in December 1849 when the Central German Government was replaced with a Federal Central Commission. The Empire struggled to be recognized by both German and foreign states. The German states, represented by the Federal Convention of the German Confederation, on July 12, 1848, acknowledged the Central German Government. In the following months, however, the larger German states did not always accept the decrees and laws of the Central German Government and the Frankfurt Parliament. Several foreign states recognized the Central Government and sent ambassadors: the United States, Sweden, the Netherlands, Belgium, Switzerland, Sardinia, Sicily and Greece. The French Second Republic and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland installed official envoys to keep contact with the Central Government. The first constitutional order of the German Empire was the Imperial Law concerning the introduction of a provisional Central Power for Germany, on June 28, 1848. With the order, the Frankfurt Parliament established the offices of  (Imperial Regent, a provisional monarch) and imperial ministers. A second constitutional order, the Frankfurt Constitution, on March 28, 1849, was accepted by 28 German states but not by the larger ones. Prussia, along with other German states, forced the Frankfurt Parliament into dissolution. Several of this German Empire's accomplishments outlasted it: the Frankfurt Constitution was used as a model in other states in the decades to follow and the electoral law was used nearly verbatim in 1867 for the election of the Reichstag of the North German Confederation. The  (Imperial Fleet) created by the Frankfurt Parliament lasted until 1852. The imperial law issuing a decree concerning bills of exchange (, General German exchange bills) was considered to be valid for nearly all of Germany. One group followed a positivist point of view: law was statutory law. A constitution for Germany had to be agreed upon with the governments of all German states. This was the opinion of the monarchists and the German states. The other group valued natural law and the principle of the sovereignty of the people higher; the National Assembly alone had the power to establish a constitution. This was the opinion of the majority of the Frankfurt Parliament, but especially the republican left. In reality the distinction was less clear. The majority of the Frankfurt Parliament, based on the liberal groups, wanted to establish a dualist system with a sovereign monarch whose powers would be constrained by a constitution and parliament. A German Confederation was created in 1815. This treaty organization for the defense of the German territories lacked, in the view of the national movement, a government and a parliament. But it was generally acknowledged by German and foreign powers \u2013 to establish a national state, it was the easiest to present it as the continuation of the Confederation. This was actually the road the National Assembly took, although it originally saw itself as a revolutionary organ. The Federal Convention (representing the German states' governments) called for elections of the Frankfurt Parliament in April/May 1848. The German states immediately acknowledged Archduke John, the provisional monarch elected by the Frankfurt Parliament. On July 12, 1848, the Federal Convention ended its activities in favor of the Imperial Regent, Archduke John. This was an implicit recognition of the Law concerning the Central Power of June 28. Of course, the German states and the Federal Convention made those decisions under pressure of the revolution. They wanted to avoid a breakup with the Frankfurt Parliament. (Already in August this pressure faltered, and the larger states started to regain power. ) According to historian Ernst Rudolf Huber, it was possible to determine a continuity or even legal identity of Confederation and the new Federal State. The old institution was enhanced with a (provisional) constitutional order and the name German Confederation was changed to German Empire. Ulrich Huber notes that none of the German states declared the Imperial Regent John and his government to be usurpatory or illegal. The Frankfurt Assembly saw itself as the German national legislature, as made explicit in the Imperial Law concerning the declaration of the imperial laws and the decrees of the provisional Central Power, from September 27, 1848. It issued laws earlier, such as the law of June 14 that created the Imperial Fleet. Maybe the most notable law declared the highly acclaimed Basic Rights of the German People, December 27, 1848. The Central Power or Central Government consisted of the Imperial Regent, Archduke John, and the ministers he appointed. He usually appointed those politicians that had the support of the Frankfurt Parliament, at least until May 1849. One of the ministers, the Prussian general Eduard von Peucker, was charged with the federal troops and federal fortifications of the German Confederation. The Central Government had not much to govern, as the administration remained in the hands of the single states. But in February 1849, 105 people worked for the Central Government (in comparison to the 10 for the Federal Convention). The Frankfurt Parliament assumed in general that the territory of the German Confederation was also the territory of the new state. Someone was a German if he was a subject of one of the German states within the German Empire (\u00a7 131, Frankfurt Constitution). Additionally it discussed the future of other territories where Germans lived. The members of parliament sometimes referred to the German language spoken in a territory, sometimes to historical rights, sometimes to military considerations (e.g. when a Polish state was rejected because it would be too weak to serve as a buffer state against Russia). One of the most disputed territories was Schleswig.\n",

        "reference": " the bot laner for FlyQuest of the LCS. He has previously played for major gaming organizations Cloud9, Team SoloMid and Immortals. WildTurtle has played in the 2013, 2014 and 2015 World Championships. WildTurtle used to play Defense of the Ancients, but transitioned to League of Legends to play with his friends. He returned to the game at the end of 9th grade after a one-year hiatus. He did not receive a high school diploma. During Season 1 of League of Legends (2010-2011), WildTurtle played for Forty Bus Gaming and Kill Steal Gaming. He played for Monomaniac eSports prior to IPL (IGN Pro League) Season 4. He left the team around 2 weeks before the tournament due to internet access issues which prevented him from practicing enough. Wildturtle was a substitute for Team Legion at the IPL Face Off: San Francisco Showdown on August 11 and 12 and played against Team WE. Later in the month, he played for Counter Logic Gaming Black at the MLG (Major League Gaming) Summer Championship, replacing Austin \"LiNk\" Shin as their mid-laner. They lost 0-2 to Team Dignitas in the second round of the tournament. On October 20 Orbit Gaming announced that they were replacing their Attack Damage Carry (ADC) Nientohsoh with WildTurtle. Nientohsoh would move to the mid position, replacing nubbypoohbear who had left the team. The team left the organization on November 1, stating that some prize money was stolen and that equipment was never given to them. They renamed to Reddit Nation, and attended the Lone Star Clash 2 event. After the tournament Quantic Gaming announced that they had acquired the team. On December 4, Quantic Gaming disbanded. Sources stated that investors withdrew funding without notifying the organization. The team was released on December 12 and renamed to the placeholder name NomNom. They finished in the top three at the Season 3 North American MLG Online Qualifiers and secured a spot to the offline qualifier for the League of Legends Championship Series (LCS). NomNom renamed to Cloud9 on January 8. They did not pass the offline qualifier for the LCS. In March, the ADC of Team SoloMid (TSM), Chaox, was benched, then removed from the organization as a result of his lackluster performance, extracurricular activities, and attitude. WildTurtle, a substitute for TSM since February, became their starting ADC after initially substituting for Chaox when he was benched. Cloud9 replaced WildTurtle with SnEaKyCaStRoO. TSM took first place in the North American League of Legends Championship Series (NA LCS) Spring Split. They lost 0-3 to Cloud9 in the finals of the NA LCS Summer Split playoffs. At the NA LCS Summer Split playoffs, TSM defeated Cloud9 in the finals 3-2, claiming first place. TSM lost 1-3 to Samsung White in the quarterfinals of the 2014 World Championship in October. In December, TSM lost 0-2 to Unicorns of Love in the quarterfinals of the Intel Extreme Masters Season (IEM) IX San Jose tournament. At the IEM Season IX \u2013 World Championship in March, TSM defeated Team WE 3-0 in the finals to win the tournament. In April, TSM claimed first place at the NA LCS Spring Split playoffs after defeating Cloud9 3-1. The team was eliminated from the Mid-Season Invitational in May in the group stage. In August, TSM lost 0-3 to Counter Logic Gaming (CLG) in the finals of the NA LCS Summer Split playoffs. TSM was eliminated from the 2015 World Championship in the group stage. On December 7 Immortals announced that they had acquired WildTurtle. Immortals finished first in the NA LCS Spring Split regular season while having the best split in NA LCS history, with a 17-1 record. Immortals lost 0-3 to TSM in the semifinals of the NA LCS Spring Split playoffs in April, then beat Team Liquid 3-0 in the third place match. Finishing second in the NA LCS Summer Split regular season, they lost 2-3 to Cloud9 in the semifinals, beating CLG 3-2 in the third-place match. Ending the season with the most championship points, they were seeded into the top of the regional qualifiers for the 2016 League of Legends World Championship, but were defeated by Cloud9 1-3, failing to qualify for the tournament. In early November, WildTurtle was negotiating with Team Dignitas, and played as a substitute for TSM at IEM XI Oakland, where the team lost to Unicorns of Love in the semifinals. He then signed with the team on December 7, dropping negotiations with Dignitas and replacing Doublelift, who was taking a break from his programing career during the 2017 NA LCS Spring Split. He was replaced on Immortals by Cody Sun.\n",

        "prefix": "Lew Jenkins (December 4, 1916 \u2013 October 30, 1981) was an American boxer and Lightweight Champion of the World. He was born in Milburn,",
        "reference": " Texas and was raised during the Great Depression. He began fighting in carnivals and later continued his boxing in the US Coast Guard. He was an exceptionally powerful puncher and 51 of his 73 wins were by knockout. His managers included Benny Woodhall, Frank Bachman, Hymie Kaplan, and Willie Ketchum and his trainer was Charley Rose. His punching power was legendary, and so was his drinking, carousing, and penchant for high-speed motorcycles. \"The two toughest opponents I had were Jack Daniels and Harley Davidson,\" Lew Jenkins stated. Jenkins took the World Lightweight Championship on May 10, 1940 in a third-round TKO against Lou Ambers at New York's Madison Square Garden. Verlin E. Jenkins was born on December 4, 1916 in Milburn, Texas to Artie James and Minnie Lee, formerly Minnie Lee White. He was the third of four children and had two older and one younger sisters. He started professional boxing around 1935 in Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona, but by 1938 was boxing regularly in Dallas. The biggest fights of his early career took place after he moved to New York in 1939. Jenkins defeated Lew Feldman on April 8, 1938 in a ten-round split decision at the Sportatorium in Dallas, Texas. Oddly, the Dallas crowd booed loudly after the decision of the judges and referees for Jenkins, the Texas native. On November 21, 1939, Jenkins scored a seventh-round technical knockout against Mike Belloise, a former World Featherweight Champion, before a crowd of 12,000 at the Bronx's New York Coliseum. Belloise was unable to answer the call of the bell for the eighth round due to the severe punishment he had taken to the body in the sixth and seventh rounds. It was later confirmed that Belloise suffered a broken rib from the bout. On January 24, 1940, Jenkins convincingly defeated Cuban boxer Chino Alvarez in a knockout only around fifteen seconds into the first round at the Sportatorium in Dallas. Jenkins landed only two or three punches and the rowdy Dallas crowd booed when the ten count was completed, with several climbing into the ring. The victory was Jenkin's ninth straight with six by knockouts. Jenkins sudden rise to prominence as a serious World Lightweight contender was not unprecedented, as he had been fighting professionally at least five years, but the quality of his opposition had increased dramatically in the last two years as many newspapers noted. When he defeated Tippy Larkin in a first-round knockout at Madison Square Garden on March 8, 1940, he was finally scheduled for a World Lightweight Title bout with reigning champion Lou Ambers. In the impressive win over Larkin, Jenkins started cautiously, then flicked a few straight lefts. After Jenkins blasted with both hands, and in \"2:41 of the first round Larkin was left flailing around in his own corner and down for the count\". Jenkins defeated Lou Ambers in New York City on May 10, 1940 to become World Lightweight Champion. Ambers was down for a count of five in the first, briefly down again from a left in the second, and was down in the third before the referee stopped the bout when Jenkins landed a final solid right to Ambers' jaw. After winning the World Lightweight Championship from Ambers, Jenkins lost his boxing discipline and spent time carousing at night and buying expensive automobiles. He drank recklessly, sometimes before bouts, and crashed several motorcycles and cars. On March 8, 1940, Jenkins scored a first-round knockout of Tippy Larkin in a non-title bout at New York's Madison Square Garden before a crowd of 11,542. \"Tearing out with the bell, the slugger from the Southwest (Jenkins) took command immediately. He threw both fists without a stop, finally connecting with a series of solid lefts and rights and Larkin dropped in his corner\". The knockout occurred at the end of the first, 2:41 into the round. Jenkins had scored five straight knockouts in his most recent New York fights. A noteworthy opponent, Larkin would take the World Light Welterweight Championship in 1946. On September 16, 1940, Jenkins managed to win a decision against Bob Montgomery in a non-title, ten-round decision, before a crowd of 12,900 at Shibe Park in Philadelphia. Jenkins was down in the third round for a count of nine. The United Press gave Jenkins five rounds to four for Montgomery, though ring officials gave Jenkins a somewhat wider margin. Montgomery would twice hold the NYSAC World Lightweight Championship in May 1943 and November 1944. On November 22, 1940, Jenkins successfully defended his World Lightweight Title against Pete Lello in a second-round knockout at New York's Madison Square Garden before a largely hostile audience of around 11,000. Jenkins knocked Lello down four times in the second, usually with strong blows to the jaw and at least twice for counts of nine. He said after the bout that he had little memory of the bout after his first knockdown in the second. Lello had formerly knocked out Jenkins in a close bout that ended in an early seventh round victory in Chicago on March 24, 1939. On December 19, 1941 Jenkins lost his World Lightweight Title against Sammy Angott before a crowd of 11,343 at New York's Madison Square Garden. Fighting with a neck injury he may have received from motorcycle and car crashes, he was outpointed over 15 rounds. From then on he lost a significant percentage of his remaining bouts, though often against quality competition. On September 30, 1949, Jenkins defeated Eddie Giosa in a ten-round unanimous decision at the Arena in Philadelphia. He had Giosa down for a count of eight in the second from a left hook, then put him to the mat again with a right to the head. He had Giosa down again in the tenth with a left hook to the head for a count of eight, though the fight continued and was determined by a points decision. Both men fought at 139 in the welterweight range. He had formerly lost to Giosa on May 2, 1949, in a fairly close split decision at the same location. The May victory was Giosa's fourth straight win. Jenkins served in the Coast Guard in World War II, where he participated in troop deployment, and found himself in the thick of battle during the Allied invasions of North Africa and the D-Day invasion of Normandy, France. He re-enlisted in the infantry at the outbreak of America's involvement in the Korean War around 1950 and was awarded the Silver Star for saving several men from enemy fire. He attempted a comeback after World War II, but was unable to regain his status as a top lightweight and welterweight. He retired from boxing in 1950. In 2003, Jenkins made the Ring Magazine's list of the 100 greatest punchers of all time. Jenkins died October 30, 1981 at the Oakland Naval Regional Medical Center after a long illness. He is buried in Arlington National Cemetery. Jenkins was admitted to the Ring Boxing Hall of Fame in 1977, the World Boxing Hall of Fame in 1983 and in 1999, the International Boxing Hall of Fame.\n",

At the instigation of Stephen Wurm the committee resolved to create a research center, the International Clearing House for Endangered Languages (ICHEL) and to publish the UNESCO Red Book of Endangered Languages based on the data it collected. Shigeru Tsuchida was to start the research center. It began in 1994 at the University of Tokyo with Tasaka Tsunoda as its director. Meanwhile, the initial reports on endangered languages had already been collected and submitted to UNESCO by regional experts in 1993. These were now turned over to ICHEL, which created a website for the red book. It continues to be updated regularly. In February 2009, UNESCO launched an online edition of the Atlas of Endangered Languages which covers the whole world, contains much more information than previous printed editions and offers the possibility to users to provide online feedback, in view of its constant updating.\n",

        "prefix": "In interpersonal relationships a fatal attraction is  when the very qualities that draw one to someone eventually contribute to relational breakup. Diane Felmlee is the major contributor in",
        "reference": " fatal attraction framework. Felmlee is currently a professor of sociology at Penn State University. When she wrote her major work on fatal attraction she was a professor at the University of California, Davis. David Orzechowicz and Carmen Fortes are also contributors to fatal attraction framework. Orzechowicz is currently a professor in the department of sociology at the University of California, Davis, where Fortes is  a Ph. D candidate. Fatal attraction research began as exploratory research attempting to connect characteristics of initial attractiveness with those later perceived as problematic. Prior to this research, there had been extensive research on attraction and relationship dissolution. However, this research was innovative in trying to correlate the same characteristics to both initial attraction and relationship breakup. In her landmark research on fatal attraction Felmlee analyzed the data from a random sample on initial attraction and the subsequent data from a self-report study of the sample respondents' about the characteristics they dislike about their partner. Felmelee then summarized her results in terms of pertinence to interpersonal theories and dialectical perspectives. One conclusion resulting from Felmlee's research was that differences were the most common type of fatal attraction. Therefore, the differences in partners that were initially attractive were not in the long run. Another conclusion was that other perceived opposite qualities such as being fun and exciting can eventually be the cause for breakup if one is fun or exciting to an extreme. Finally, it seems that being attracted to a narcissistic person is also a common type of fatal attraction. Narcissism is defined as the inordinate fascination with oneself, excessive self-love, or vanity. Being attracted to a narcissistic person is another common occurrence of fatal attraction. Narcissistic individuals are described as attractive in the beginning because they are perceived as confident, charming and entertaining. Narcissists are, in part, viewed this way in the beginning because they are making the effort to be seen in this light. As described with the other personality traits in fatal attraction, over time the same confidence and charm once associated with the narcissistic person are later described as arrogance and manipulation. The interpersonal implications of fatal attraction research are prevalent in dating relationships as well as marriages. The knowledge that the characteristics that may attract two people can also be detrimental may lead to higher success in dating relationships. It can cause those in dating relationships to ask more probing questions about each other's personality. Such questions can aid in establishing the line between initially attractive characteristics and potentially fatal personality clashes. In a marriage the knowledge of fatal attraction can be used to explain some of the problems that married couples experience. Fatal attraction also affects interpersonal relationships by shedding light on the phrase \"opposites attract\". Most will agree that the phrase holds truths and fatal attraction confirms this. However, fatal attraction adds depth to that phrase by suggesting that there may be a balance of opposite and likeness if a relationship will endure over time. For this reason, fatal attraction research may be suggestive of the need to have longer dating relationships. Fatal attraction research explains phenomena in interpersonal relationships as well it adds value to a larger body of research on interpersonal relationships. The concepts covered in fatal attraction are very similar to the concepts covered in relational dialectics. Where one approach leaves off, another adds new layers of insight and understanding.\n",

This view is supported by the omission of incidents and details which, in spite of the altered conditions under which the poem was composed, would naturally have been preserved in any imitation of the Thebaid, while again certain modifications of the version of Statius can hardly be due to the author's invention but point to an ancient origin. As in other poems of the same kind, the marvellous disappears; the Greeks adopt the French methods of warfare and the French code of chivalric love. The Roman dates from the 12th century (c. 1150-55), and is written, not in the tirades of the chansons de geste, but in octosyllabic rhymed couplets. It was once attributed to Beno\u00eet de Sainte-Maure; but all that can be said is that the Thebes is prior to the Roman de Troie, of which Beno\u00eet was undoubtedly the author. The Thebes is preserved also in several French prose redactions, the first of which, printed in the 16th century under the name of Edipus, belongs to the early years of the 13th century, and originally formed part of a compilation of ancient history, Histoire ancienne jusqu'\u00e0 Caesar. The first volume of Les histoires de Paul Crose traduites en fran\u00e7ais contains a free and amplified version of the Thebes. The Siege of Thebes, translated from a French redaction of the Roman de Thebes in about 1420 by John Lydgate  was a supplementary Canterbury Tale, that was printed by Wynkyn de Worde about 1500. From the Roman de Thebes also were possibly derived the Ipomedon and its sequel Protheselaus, two romans d'aventures written about the end of the 12th century by Hue de Rotelande, an Anglo-Norman poet who lived in Credenhill, near Hereford. The author asserts that he translated from a Latin book lent him by Gilbert Fitz-Baderon, 4th lord of Monmouth, but in reality he has written romances of chivalry on the usual lines, the names of the characters alone being derived from antiquity.\n",

He was a member of the Alpha Omicron chapter of Theta Chi fraternity while in college. After finishing college, Edwards received offers from three NFL franchises, the recently created Boston Braves, the New York Giants, and the Portsmouth Spartans. He chose the highest bid: $1,500 for 10 games from the Braves, a team that would later become the Boston Redskins and then move to Washington, D.C. in 1937. Edwards played for the Braves/Redskins for nine seasons, winning All-NFL honors from major media outlets every year of his career except his last one. Edwards sustained a career-ending injury during a coin-tossing ceremony prior to a game against the New York Giants in 1940. After calling the coin toss and shaking hands with college teammate Mel Hein (the Giants' captain), Edwards attempted to pivot around to head back to his sideline. However, his cleats caught in the grass and his oft-injured knee gave way, ending his season and ultimately his career. Edwards was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1969, which he described as \"certainly the greatest honor\". He was introduced at the ceremony by Mel Hein, who said, \"The thing I'll remember most about Turk Edwards is that he was a true sportsman, a true gentleman and still is\". Edwards continued with the Redskins as an assistant coach from 1941 to 1945 and then as the head coach from 1946 to 1948. After 17 consecutive seasons with the Redskins, Edwards retired from professional football. After retiring from football, Edwards returned to the Pacific Northwest and operated a sporting goods store in Seattle's University District.\n",

His brother Cathal was at home when he was killed and recalled that while being interrogated by The Tans he heard gunshots, when he was finally allowed to go outside he saw his brother's body below a window in the backyard in a pool of blood.

Shortly thereafter, she met Dario Fo, whom she married in 1954. Their son, Jacopo was born on 31 March 1955. In 1958, she co-founded the Dario Fo\u2013Franca Rame Theatre Company in Milan, with Fo as the director and writer, and Rame the leading actress and administrator. Rame continued working with Fo through many plays and several theatre companies, popular success and government censorship. She was active in Soccorso Rosso (Red Aid), writing letters and providing books for prisoners and assisting their families and lawyers. In the 1970s, Rame began writing plays (often stage monologues) of her own, such as Grasso \u00e8 bello! and Tutta casa, letto e chiesa, which displayed a markedly feminist bent. In March 1973, fascists who were reportedly commissioned by high-ranking officials in Milan's Carabinieri (Italian gendarmerie) abducted Rame, held her at gunpoint and dumped her in a van. They raped her, beat her, burnt her with cigarettes, slashed her with razor blades and left her in a park. She returned to the stage after two months with new anti-fascist monologues.

        "prefix": "Oliver Twist is a 1997 American made-for-television film based on Charles Dickens\u2019s 1839 novel of the same title. The film was",
        "reference": " directed by Tony Bill, written by Monte Merrick and Stephen Sommers, and produced by Walt Disney Television. It stars Richard Dreyfuss, Elijah Wood, David O'Hara, and Alex Trench as the titular character. As in most film adaptations of this novel, Monks, Oliver's half-brother, is not in the film. There are other changes as well. The bookseller does not testify for Oliver at his trial, but Rose Maylie does. Most of the changes are minor, but a major one is that when Oliver is taken in by Fagin's gang he himself, and not the Widow Corney, is in possession of his mother's locket, and Oliver has come to London, not just to seek his fortune, but to discover his true identity. Mr. Bumble, Corney's assistant, is only in one scene, and the Widow Corney's role is expanded. And, as in the musical and the 1968 film Oliver!, Nancy is murdered at London Bridge, not in her bedroom as in the novel. Oliver Twist premiered on ABC as part of The Wonderful World of Disney on November 16, 1997. A woman gives birth to a boy in an orphanage owned by the Widow Corney, dying as she does so. She leaves him a locket, containing a portrait of her mother, which Corney takes. Her assistant names the child Oliver Twist from his rotating alphabetical list of names. Six years later, Oliver, now working in the orphanage, requests to see his locket. Corney says he can have it when he\u2019s twelve. Six years later, Oliver is forced on the night before his 12th birthday into drawing straws at dinner for who has to ask Corney for more food. After drawing the shortest one, she throws him out of the workhouse for daring to ask her such a question without his locket. He returns to steal it at night and heads out to London. Once there, Oliver, hungry, is stopped from stealing an apple by a young man named Jack Dawkins, also known as the Artful Dodger, who explains that he\u2019s a professional thief and proud of his work. He offers to take Oliver in with the band of boys he lives with and his boss, Fagin, an old and sly man who teaches the group how to steal. Upon arriving, Fagin takes Oliver's locket as Oliver is dressed and welcomed. Oliver also meets Bill Sikes-a thief and murderer to whom Fagin owes an enormous sum-and his kind girlfriend, Nancy. Dodger begins to teach Oliver about the art of thievery that same day. At night, Oliver catches Fagin admiring his treasure which he keeps hidden in a box and is threatened with death if he steals from it. However, when asked, Fagin admits that it is where he is keeping Oliver's locket. Three months later, Oliver is sent out to pick his first pocket as Dodger orchestrates the plan. While stealing a watch, Oliver is caught red-handed. Thinking quickly, Dodger grabs the watch instead and runs off with Oliver, but he escapes while Oliver is mistakenly identified as the thief. Dodger quietly hurries to court to try to rescue him, where Mr. Brownlow (the victim)'s niece, Rose, has testified for Oliver that he was not the boy, and Oliver refused to name the culprit. Rose offers Oliver to be a guest at their mansion in Grosvenor Square. There, he sees a portrait on the wall of the same lady his locket contains. When told it is Mr. Brownlow's late wife, and that they had one daughter who always carried a gold locket with that portrait, he and Rose realize that it means he may be Mr. Brownlow's grandson and her cousin. Meanwhile, Dodger manages to locate Oliver. Deciding that he knows too much about the group to be left on his own, Sikes convinces Fagin to let him kidnap Oliver with Dodger and Nancy's help. However, Nancy does so unwillingly, and Dodger refuses to put Oliver in the bag intended to be used for his abduction. Back at the hideout, Oliver confirms that he let nothing slip about the group, but tells Nancy that he loved the Brownlows. Nancy tries to return Oliver to the mansion, but is seen in the street by Sikes and forced to go back. Suspicious, Sikes hires Dodger to follow her the next day. Sikes later weasels out of Oliver that he knows where Fagin's treasure is kept. At night, he forces him to go to the Brownlow's to steal at gunpoint. Inside, Oliver purposely drops the bag of silver he's holding to wake Rose. Sikes and Oliver escape, but Mr. Brownlow sees Oliver, confirming his suspicion that he is a thief. Dodger encourages Oliver to escape if he gets the chance. The next day, Nancy goes to the Brownlows unknowingly followed by Dodger. She tells them of Oliver's abduction and agrees to return him at London Bridge at midnight. Dodger, threatened by Sikes, admits of overhearing the agreement. Still wanting Oliver to be free, he takes him to the bridge himself to throw Sikes off the trail. Unfortunately, Nancy, unaware of Dodger's plan, is murdered there by a furious Sikes who accuses her of double-crossing him. Meanwhile, Oliver has gone back to the hideout to retrieve his locket. Sikes walks in the door and sees the treasure. As he attempts to flee with it himself, Fagin arrives, followed by Dodger who stops Sikes, furious at Nancy's murder. Nancy's dead body has been found, and the police follow Sikes's dog to the hideout. Sikes locks the door, takes the box and Oliver (as a hostage) up to the roof, and leaves Dodger and Fagin below. On the roof, Oliver grabs the box from Sikes, who turns on him and slips. His neck gets caught in a coil of rope, and he is hung by the noose on the spot as the police watch. Dodger is arrested by them for his pilfering, and while Fagin negotiates with Oliver for the locket, ultimately returns it. The locket finally proves that Oliver is in fact Mr. Brownlow\u2019s grandson by the matching of the portraits. After bidding a fond farewell to the arrested Dodger promising to see him again someday, Oliver is last seen sleeping happily in his new home. Eileen Colgan as Mrs. Bedwin, the Brownlow's maid. Lisa Dwan as Agnes, Oliver's mother.\n",

Smith was inspired to become a writer at age eight, when he became bedbound for three months while suffering rheumatic fever and amused himself by reading books, then inventing new characters and endings for the stories. He attended Brooklyn College in 1947 but dropped out after a year when he proved unable to do chemistry or calculus. He served in the U.S. Army from 1951 to 1953, spending time stationed overseas in Germany. When he returned to America, he married his wife, Claire Medney, in 1954. Together, they had two children, Heidi and Roger. Between 1957 and 1965, Smith was a copywriter at an ad agency, and a partner and creative director at Smith and Toback from 1967 to 1970. Smith started writing stories for young readers \"by accident\" while telling his daughter bedtime stories, which he then wrote down. He also took inspiration from his own childhood; Jelly Belly refers to his memories of being the fattest child in his elementary school. In 1970, he became a full-time writer; his first children's book, Chocolate Fever, was published in 1972 and won the Massachusetts Children's Book Award. As of 2001, Chocolate Fever had sold over 2 million paperback copies and was listed at number 119 on Publishers Weekly'''s all-time list of bestselling children's paperbacks. His other works for young readers include The War with Grandpa, Bobby Baseball, Mostly Michael, and The Squeaky Wheel, a touching but humorous story about a child coping with his parents' divorce. Smith also penned several novels for adults, most notably Sadie Shapiro's Knitting Book (1973), and its two sequels Sadie Shapiro in Miami (1977) and Sadie Shapiro, Matchmaker (1980); as well as Jane's House'' (1982).

        "reference": " born in Montreux, Switzerland. After apprenticing as a cook, Nobs worked in the Tourism Office of Montreux. He later went to New York, where he met Nesuhi Erteg\u00fcn, the then-president of Atlantic Records. He also met Roberta Flack and invited her to the Rose d\u2019Or de Montreux. Later, Aretha Franklin made her first visit to Europe thanks to him. At the age of 31, while he was director of the Tourism Office of Montreux, he organized the first jazz festival featuring artists such as Charles Lloyd, Keith Jarrett, Ron McLure and Jack DeJohnette. This new festival was an immediate success, and gained a reputation far beyond Switzerland. Nobs quickly transformed his festival into an international gathering place for lovers of jazz. In 1971, Deep Purple decided to produce and record their album Machine Head in Montreux. The group was also scheduled to record at the Montreux Casino, shortly after Frank Zappa performed. During Zappa's concert, the venue caught fire and reduced the Casino to ashes. Nobs saved several young people who had hidden in the casino, thinking they would be sheltered from the flames. Nobs, who had served as a volunteer fireman, knew that the casino was not actually a safe place and acted immediately to get them out. This act earned him a mention (in the line \"Funky Claude was running in and out pulling kids out the ground\") in the song \"Smoke on the Water\", which is about the incident. Also, on the inner liner of the original album, Nobs' picture was the only one labeled with a name other than those of the band members themselves. In 1973, Nobs became the director of the Swiss branch of Warner, Elektra and Atlantic. On the live Jethro Tull album Bursting Out (recorded on 28 May 1978 in Bern), one can hear Nobs announcing in Swiss German, \"Gueten Abig mitenand, und herzlich willkommen in der Festhalle Bern\"! (\"Good evening everybody, and welcome to the Festhall of Bern\"). During the 1990s, Nobs shared the directorship of the festival with Quincy Jones, and made Miles Davis an honorary host. The festival continued to diversify and was no longer exclusively devoted to jazz. In 2004, the festival attracted 200,000 visitors. On 25 September 2004, Nobs received the Tourism Prize of Salz & Pfeffer. The canton of Vaud gave him the \"Prix du Rayonnement\" for his contributions to music. He has also received an honorary doctorate. Nobs played harmonica on the opening track of the 1983 Chris Rea album Water Sign. In 2005, during the referendum campaign on registered partnership in Switzerland for same-sex couples he came out publicly to support the new law. At the time, Claude Nobs had been in a relationship with his partner, Thierry Amsallem, since 1987. On 24 December 2012, he had an accident while Nordic skiing in Switzerland and fell into a coma.

The legislation was modelled on the liquor laws that had originated in Iowa. The law was opposed by some California residents who gathered signatures for a veto referendum, 53% of voters voted yes and the new act became law. The Act stated \"every building or place used for the purpose of prostitution, and every building or place in or upon which acts of prostitution, are held or occur, is a nuisance which should be enjoined, abated, and prevented, and for which damages may be recovered\". By 1920, 33 states has passed similar legislation. Under the act owners of the buildings where prostitution takes place are fined by the city. This led many property owners to be more vigilant of the activity which took place in their buildings, as well as to institute discriminatory renting practices, such as not allowing single women to rent a first floor apartment. In some places, women could not rent an apartment at all. As a result, prostitution moved to the streets, making the practice more dangerous. After many years, most red light districts ceased to exist under this act. The legislation was still in use in 2018, when it was used to shut down San Jose massage parlors run by Hung Nguyen.\n",

        "reference": " information in Brazil. IBGE performs a decennial national census; questionnaires account for information such as age, household income, literacy, education, occupation and hygiene levels. IBGE is a public institute created in 1936 under the name National Institute of Statistics. Its founder and chief proponent was statistician M\u00e1rio Augusto Teixeira de Freitas. The current name dates from 1938. Its headquarters are located in Rio de Janeiro, and its current president is Susana Cordeiro Guerra. It was made a federal agency by Decree-Law No. 161 on February 13, 1967, and is linked to the Ministry of the Economy, inside the Secretariat of Planning, Budget and Management. 585 data collection agencies in major cities. Headquarters in Rio de Janeiro (Rio de Janeiro was the capital of the Republic when the Office was established). Also in Rio de Janeiro are five boards and a school: Executive Directors (ED), Directorate of Research (DPE), Department of Geosciences (DGC), Department of Informatics (DI), Center for Documentation and Information Dissemination (CDDI) and the National School of Statistical Sciences. The Directorate of Research is responsible for planning and coordinating the research of nature and processing of statistical data collected by the state units; the Department of Geosciences is responsible for basic cartography, the national geodetic system, with a survey of natural resources and environment and by survey and geographical studies. The Center for Documentation and Information Dissemination is responsible for documentation and dissemination of information produced by the institute as well as coordinating the 27 CDDIs in the country, and the National School of Statistical Sciences, besides being responsible for training the institute's employees, is a federal institution of higher learning that offers the following courses: BA in Statistics; specialization in Environmental Analysis and Management Planning, and Masters in Population Studies and Social Research. The IBGE also maintains the Roncador Ecological Reserve, situated 35\u00a0km south of Bras\u00edlia. Gives an overview of the economy and describes the phenomena of economic life: production, consumption and wealth accumulation, providing a comprehensive and simplified representation of these data. The System of National Accounts IBGE follows the most recent UN recommendations expressed in the Handbook of National Accounts (System of National Accounts  1993, SNA), including the calculation of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and the Input-output matrix. Displays the current value and volume indices (1991 = 100) every quarter for the Gross Domestic Product at market prices, taxes on products, value added at basic prices, personal consumption, government consumption, Gross fixed capital formation, changes in inventories, exports and imports of goods and services. Two series of index numbers are calculated: the basis of the previous year and chained with reference to 1990 (1990 = 100). The series is seasonally adjusted using X-12-ARIMA, enabling calculation of the rates of change over the previous quarter. The IBGE survey was started in 1988 and restructured after 1998, when their results were integrated into the current System of National Accounts. The annual weights are derived from this new system accounts. The legislation, according to Federal Decree No. 73,177 of November 20, 1973 and Law No. 5534 of November 14, 1968, modified by Law No. 5878 of May 11, 1978, deals with the obligation and confidentiality of information collected by IBGE, which is intended exclusively for statistical purposes and has no legal value, not being usable as evidence or proof. Failure to provide information within the specified deadlines, or providing false information is a crime subject to a fine, initially, of up to 10 times the highest minimum wage in the country, and up to twice this limit on later occasions. The IBGE performs various kinds of censuses, although the best known is the population census (statistics on the population of the country). In Brazil, the population censuses are conducted every 10 years solely by the IBGE, as this is the body established by law as responsible for their production. The population count is made between the interval between two censuses, usually five years after the last five or before the next. Aims to update the data on the number of inhabitants, and is not always applied in all municipalities. The first population count was conducted in 1996, not only to update population data, but also to get municipality level data after the emergence and redefinition of new municipalities after the 1500 Population Census of 1991. After the census conducted in 2000, the IBGE population count conducted in 2007 which aimed to update the population estimates, but also incorporated the demographic changes occurring in the territory since the last survey of reference. The last demographic census was conducted in 2010, and the next one will be conducted in 2020. The population count is of great importance to Brazil's cities, because the annual grant of funds from the Municipalities Participation Fund is determined mainly by the estimates of population variation provided by IBGE, which directly influence the calculation of the coefficients used to transfer the fund to the municipalities. The agricultural census collects information on agricultural establishments, forests and/or aquaculture of all municipalities of a country. The goal of this research is to update previous census data and to provide information about economic, social, and environmental farming. Since 1996, the census has occurred roughly every 10 years. The 1996 agricultural census was conducted by IBGE from August 1995 to July 1996, in reference to Brazil's crop harvests. The following agricultural census was undertaken in 2007, and surveyed agricultural activity for the 2006 calendar year. The 2017 agricultural census returned to a survey period based on crop harvests, and was conducted from October 2016 to September 2017, with results released in 2018.\n",

She is the former Director of the Graduate Diversity Program at U.C. Berkley. In 2003, Trujillo authored her first novel entitled What Night Brings and published it with Curbstone Press. What Night Brings focuses on the Chicana lesbian character, Marci Cruz, and her upbringing in a conservative Catholic home in 1960s Northern California. Through the fictionalized account of Cruz, Trujillo questions issues of patriarchy and homophobia within Chicana/o culture. Trujillo was born in New Mexico, and lived there for several years before moving to Northern California. There, her grandmother ran a grocery store in the town of Las Vegas where Trujillo spent many days as a child playing. Trujillo would later use these early memories as inspiration for her works such as Faith and Fat Chances and Dogtown which both carry messages about class struggle and the impact of gentrification. Her grandmother's store was eventually claimed as eminent domain and paved over to make way for a highway, which meant the loss of income she used to support her seven children. As an adult, Trujillo still prioritizes annual visits to New Mexico; in an interview about her book Faith and Fat Chances, Trujillo observed, \u201cI feel very connected to the land, to the people and the spirit of the country. It\u2019s always been a part of my life. Trujillo studied human development at the University of California, Davis. After earning her Bachelor's degree, she went on to graduate school at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, where she earned her PhD in Education Psychology. It was during her time in graduate school that her writing became an integral part of her daily life. She eventually moved to Berkeley, California. In 1991, Trujillo embarked on editing for Chicana Lesbians: The Girls Our Mothers Warned Us About, an anthology of essays and articles by Chicana Lesbian writers. Her inspiration for editing Chicana Lesbians came from the work of other anthologies; Trujillo noted that reading Juanita Ramos's Compa\u00f1eras: Latina Lesbians motivated her to expand upon the knowledge of Chicana Lesbian experiences. As she later explained, she \"wanted to see more about the intricacies and specifics of lesbianism and our culture,\" for her this meant incorporating writings which discussed issues such as racism and familial rejection of identity. Chicana Lesbians would later be awarded with the Lambda Literary Award for Best Lesbian Anthology. In 1997, she edited and published Living Chicana Theory, a collection of works addressing Chicana subjectivity. The variety of works included in the anthology ranged from theoretical to more artistic forms of critique; some notable contributors included Teresa C\u00f3rdova, Gloria Anzald\u00faa, and Antonia Casta\u00f1eda. The anthology interrogates the presence of coloniality in the academy as well as Chicanx culture at large, and explores meanings of identity construction in Chicana lives.\n",

        "reference": " a Welsh Tory politician who sat in the English and British House of Commons for 25 years from 1701 to 1735. Mostyn was born on 31 July 1673, in Flintshire, north Wales. He was the eldest son of Sir Thomas Mostyn, 2nd Baronet, of Mostyn, and his wife Bridget Savage, daughter and heiress of Darcy Savage  of Leighton, Cheshire. He matriculated at Jesus College, Oxford on 10 February 1690, aged 15. On the death of his father in 1692, he inherited his baronetcy and estates. Although the estates were extensive and with a good income, his extravagance and love of horse racing led him into financial difficulties and he needed to make a good marriage. He married Lady Essex Finch, the daughter of Daniel Finch, 2nd Earl of Nottingham (with \u00a37,000) on 20 July 1703. Mostyn was appointed Sheriff of Caernarvonshire for 1701. He was a Tory and a supported his father in law Daniel Finch, 2nd Earl of Nottingham before and after his marriage. At the second general election of 1701 he stood for Parliament at two seats. He was defeated in a contest at Cheshire, but was returned unopposed as Member of Parliament (MP) for Flintshire. In August 1702, he was returned unopposed for Flint and also elected MP for Cheshire, which he chose to represent. He was appointed Constable of Flint Castle in 1702. He voted for tacking on the Occasional Conformity Bill to the Land-tax Bill in 1705 and this may have led to the loss of his seat and office of Constable. At the 1705 general election he was defeated in the poll at Cheshire but could fall back on the seat at Flint Boroughs where he was returned unopposed. He was returned unopposed for Flintshire in 1708 and 1710 and in 1711, he was appointed paymaster of the marines. He voted against the articles of commerce in 1713. At the 1713 general election, he was returned at Flint Boroughs. He was one of the four tellers of the exchequer from 30 December 1714 until 22 June 1716. He was also Custos Rotulorum of Flintshire from 1714 to 1717. Mostyn was appointed Constable of Flint Castle again in 1715 and held the post until he passed it on to his son in 1728. At the 1715 general election, he was returned unopposed for Flintshire. He voted against the Peerage Bill in 1719. He was returned unopposed again for Flintshire in 1722 and 1727. In 1727, he was re-appointed Custos Rotulorum of Flintshire and retained the post until his death in 1739. He voted against Walpole's excise scheme in 1733, and having opposed the Septennial Bill, supported the motion for its repeal in 1734. He retired from Parliament at the 1734 general election. In consideration of his services and the expenses he incurred as paymaster of the marines, he was allowed a sum of \u00a3300 for eight years. There is also among the 'Treasury Papers' a dormant warrant in favour of Mostyn as controller of the fines for the counties of Chester, Flint, and Carnarvon, dated 31 July 1704. Mostyn died on 5 May 1739, at his seat in Carnarvonshire and was buried at Llanrhos, Caernarvonshire. By his wife, who died of smallpox on 23 May 1721, he had six sons and six daughters. He was succeeded by his eldest son, Thomas, with the death of whose grandson Thomas in 1831 the baronetcy became extinct. Three of his other sons were unmarried: Roger was a Canon of Windsor, Savage Mostyn was a vice-admiral in the Royal Navy, and John Mostyn was an officer in the British Army and a Member of Parliament.

        "reference": " in 1967 by the merger of the British, German and Irish divisions of the Ford Motor Company. The front-engined Ford Transit range of panel vans launched in 1965, was the first formal co-operation between the two entities, simultaneously developed to replace the German Ford Taunus Transit and the British Ford Thames 400E. Prior to this, the two companies avoided marketing their vehicles in one another's domestic markets, and in much of the rest of western Europe were direct competitors, with totally separate product lines, despite being owned by the same American parent, in a similar manner to General Motors\u2019 Opel and Vauxhall subsidiaries at the same time - indeed GM followed Ford's precedent in the 1970s by merging the operations of Opel and Vauxhall into General Motors Europe. The process took several years to complete, as new model ranges arrived and the older model ranges were gradually phased out. The first new model launched after the creation of Ford of Europe was the Escort, built in England from October 1967, and launched to market at the end of that year. The Escort was a rear-wheel drive small family saloon that took the place of the British Anglia range and was built in both Britain and, from 1970, Germany - although it was sold in Germany from the outset. It was first available as a two-door saloon and later in estate, van, and four-door saloon bodystyles. Power came from 950 CC, 1100 CC, and 1300 CC petrol engines. Later there was also a 2000 cc unit which came in the RS2000 performance version and was capable of. It quickly became popular with buyers, outselling in the UK key competitors from BMC (later British Leyland), Vauxhall (Opel in Germany) and the Rootes Group. The Escort would never achieve such dominance in Europe's largest auto market, but nevertheless took significant market share from the Opel and Volkswagen competitors of the time. Ford Europe's second new car launch was the Capri sporting coup\u00e9 at the beginning of 1969. Loosely based on Ford UK's rear-wheel drive Mk II Cortina saloon platform, it came with engines ranging from 1300 cc to 3000 cc and was made in Britain and Germany (with a different range of German V4 and V6 engines), and quickly became popular with buyers who wanted something different from BMC's MGB GT and the Rootes Group's Sunbeam Alpine. August 1970 saw the launch of the British Ford Cortina Mk III and its German cousin, the Taunus (replacing the Taunus 12M & 15M). The British and German models were based on the same platform, but had different sheet metal and used engines from their home countries, though both models could be had with the new German-built 2000cc OHC petrol engine. By 1972 the Cortina was the best-selling car in Britain. In the spring of 1972, Ford Europe replaced their top of the range models from Britain (Zephyr/Zodiac) and Germany (17M/20M/26M) with the Consul and Granada (large sedan, estate and coup\u00e9) which was aimed directly at the Opel Rekord, Rover P6, Audi 100 and Triumph 2000. It quickly outsold its rivals in many countries and in 1973 was the tenth best-selling car in Britain. Like the Capri and Cortina/Taunus models, the early Consuls and Granadas were built in both Britain and Germany, each with a unique range of national engines. A revised Capri II arrived in early 1974, which saw a hatchback replacing the traditional \"boot\". This was the first time that Ford had produced a car with a hatchback, adopting this new concept which had first been patented by Renault in the mid-1960s. Ford launched a Ford Escort (Europe) at the start of 1975, with a heavily restyled exterior and more spacious interior, but an almost identical mechanical design. The entry-level 950 cc engine, which was rare in any country, was discontinued. In 1975, Ford overtook British Leyland (the combine which included Austin, Morris and Rover) as the most popular make of car in the United Kingdom. 1976 saw Ford Europe enter the supermini market with its first ever front-wheel-drive model. The Fiesta MK1 was built at the company's new Valencia plant in Spain (and would also be produced at Dagenham and Cologne), and came with 950 cc, 1100 cc and 1300 cc petrol engines. From 1981, it was available with a 1600 cc unit for the sporty XR2 version. Britain where it launched in early 1977 and most of the rest of Europe took to it straight away and it was quickly among the best-selling cars in most of the continent, fighting off competition from the Volkswagen Polo, Renault 5, Fiat 127, Vauxhall Chevette and Peugeot 104. 1976 also saw the launch of the Cortina MK4 and Taunus, that continued to top the sales charts in Britain and fight off competition from a growing number of equally competent rivals, namely the Vauxhall Cavalier/Opel Ascona and Chrysler Alpine. It would remain in production until 1982, as the last product in the Ford Europe range to feature different model names on different markets. Ford launched the Mk II Granada range in September 1977. In 1976, all Granada production had been concentrated to Cologne, Germany. The Consul badge was abandoned in 1975. The Mk III Capri coup\u00e9 arrived in early 1978. By now Capri production was also concentrated at Cologne. 1980 saw one of the most important car launches in Ford's history. The MK3 Escort went on sale across Britain and Europe in September, with its ultra-modern styling and updated front-wheel drive mechanical layout. It was also available as a hatchback for the first time, with no saloon version on offer until the 1983 launch of the related Orion. The 2000 cc engine was dropped, and the range-topping Escort was now the XR3 which came with a fuel-injected 1600 cc unit. The 1980s saw a radical change in most of the European Fords, which had begun in September 1980 when the Escort switched to front-wheel drive and a hatchback from the traditional rear-wheel drive saloon. 20 years of Cortina production came to an end in October 1982 with the launch of the new Ford Sierra. The new car retained the traditional rear-wheel-drive chassis, perhaps surprisingly at the time when a front-wheel drive system was becoming almost exclusive in this sector of car. But in place of its predecessor's conventional, square styling was Sierra's ultramodern aerodynamic styling that was way ahead of its time compared to the competition. Initial sales were disappointing, but demand soon increased and the Sierra was Britain's third best-selling car in 1983 \u2013 its first full year on sale. It was built in Great Britain and Belgium and sold well just about everywhere it went. Cosworth versions of the Sierra were built from 1986, all of which were capable of. The three-door Sierra hatchback, mostly sold with only a 1. 3 petrol engine, was not a popular choice and had been discontinued by the time the Sierra was facelifted in early 1987 when a Sapphire saloon version was launched and the 1. 3 engine dropped. The original Sierra Cosworth was the last model in the range to feature a three-door hatchback. 1983 saw the seven-year-old Ford Fiesta receive an updated MK2 version that retained the three-door hatchback bodyshell but smoothed out the previously boxy edges to give it a more modern look. The sporty XR2 version was relaunched and power output was increased, as well as receiving the first five-speed gearbox ever fitted to a Fiesta. Also in 1983, Ford introduced a new four-door saloon to meet the demands of buyers looking for a booted alternative to the Escort and Sierra hatchbacks and estates. The saloon derived version of the Escort was named as the Orion but was aimed more upmarket car than the Escort with no 1. 1 litre engined version and initially only GL and Ghia trim levels. It was almost as long as a Sierra and many saw it as a true replacement for the traditional Cortina. Ford launched another ground-breaking new car in May 1985 with the Granada-replacing Ford Scorpio \u2013 although the Granada name was retained in the United Kingdom and Ireland \u2013 \"Scorpio\" being used as a sub-brand for the highest specification models. It was based on a stretched version of Sierra's rear-wheel-drive chassis and was far more modern looking than any other cars in its sector at this time, being similar in appearance to the smaller Sierra. It was also the world's first volume production car to feature anti-lock brakes as standard. High equipment levels, a comfortable interior, and solid build quality ensured that the German-built Scorpio was a success all over Europe, and was voted European Car of the Year for 1986. A saloon version had joined the range by early 1990, as had a 2. 9 V6 Cosworth high-performance hatchback while an estate version arrived in early 1992 as it was nearing replacement. An updated Escort and Orion appeared in March 1986 \u2013 often erroneously called the \"Mark 4\", it featured Scorpio-influenced front-end styling, revised engine options, and an all-new interior. Production of the Capri coup\u00e9 ended in December 1986 after 18 years and there was no replacement, as sporting coup\u00e9s were less popular at this time following the rise in popularity of fast hatchbacks such as the Ford Escort XR3i, Vauxhall Astra GTE, Peugeot 309 GTI and Volkswagen Golf GTI. Ford had proved successful in this sector with faster versions of the Fiesta, Escort, and Sierra. The third generation Fiesta was launched in March 1989 and the main news of the launch was the long-awaited availability of a five-door version \u2013 something that was already available on key rivals like the Austin Metro, Vauxhall Nova, Fiat Uno, SEAT Ibiza and the Peugeot 205. New to the range were the new 1. 0 and 1. 1 HCS (High Compression Swirl) petrol engines which ran alongside the long-running 1. 4 unit. There was also a 1. 8 diesel as well as the 1. 6 fuel injected XR2i and RS Turbo sports models - the first Fiestas to feature fuel injection. Upmarket Ghia models were the first versions of the Fiesta to feature items such as electric windows and anti-lock brakes. For much of the 1980s, the Ford Escort was the most popular model of car in the world, and from 1982 to 1989 it was the best-selling new car in the UK every year. Despite a facelift in March 1986, it was started to look a little dated by the end of the decade in the face of newer rivals like the Rover 200, Peugeot 309, Fiat Tipo and Renault 19. The fifth generation Escort was launched in September 1990, along with the Orion saloon, but the motoring public and press gave it mixed to negative reviews. The car's styling lacked the flair of some rivals and it received mostly negative ratings for ride and handling, while it also retained the engine line-up of the previous models with 1. 3, 1. 4 & 1. 6 petrol units and a 1. 8 diesel. The standard Escort models were later joined by the RS2000, XR3i and RS Cosworth performance versions that attracted a much more positive reaction. The RS2000 nameplate had been abandoned back in 1980 and the new version was undoubtedly the best, with its 2. 0 16-valve I4 engine and the option of four-wheel drive, as well as its impressive top speed of more than. The RS Cosworth was a turbocharged version of the RS2000 and had a top speed of  which helped bolster its fortunes in international rallies. In spite of this and impressive new models being launched by rival companies Vauxhall and Rover, Ford were still firmly positioned at the top of the British car sales charts in the early 1990s and sold well in virtually all European countries, expanding into Eastern Europe at the beginning of the 1990s following the collapse of communism. They even enlisted the help of Brian May to record a new song \u2013 Driven by you \u2013 which featured in their new TV advertising campaign for the whole Ford range in the UK. Ford responded to criticism of the Escort's shortcomings in September 1992 with a minor facelift which saw the introduction of impressive new 1. 4, 1. 6 and 1. 8 Zetec 16-valve units, the latter of which also found its way into the Fiesta RS1800. The Orion also received similar improvements, only for the name to be shelved a year later and the saloon models absorbed into the Escort range. Ride and handling was also improved. For 1993, Ford introduced a standard driver's airbag on all production models, with many cars also coming with a passenger's airbag as either standard or optional equipment. February 1993 saw Ford launch a ground-breaking new family car in the shape of the Mondeo \u2013 replacement for the Sierra made to rival the newer Opel Vectra/Vauxhall Cavalier, Peugeot 405 and Nissan Primera. Finally making the transition to front-wheel drive, the Mondeo came with an impressive range of new 16-valve Zetec petrol engines as well as a 2. 5 V6 that joined the line-up in 1994. It was also one of the first volume production cars to feature an airbag as standard. Hatchback, saloon and estate versions made up the range which won European Car of the Year accolade later the year. 1993 also saw the launch of its first European 4x4 model, the Maverick which was based on the Nissan Terrano II. However, the Maverick was not a strong seller and it was discontinued within five years. 1994 was also the year where Ford regained leadership of the large family car sector market in Britain in terms of sales, as the Vauxhall Cavalier had been the best seller of this size for the previous four years. From 1996 to 2001, Ford also imported its Explorer SUV to Europe from the USA, but like the smaller Spanish built Maverick it was not a strong seller either. Ford re-entered the coup\u00e9 market in early 1994 with its American-built, Mazda-based Probe. Available with 2. 0 16-valve and 2. 5 V6 petrol engines, the Probe was well regarded for its handling and performance but failed to sell as well as Ford might have hoped and was withdrawn from Europe three years later. Its American-built replacement, the Ford Cougar, was imported from Europe but was even shorter-lived and less successful in Europe, with imports finishing after just two years. 1995 saw Ford update its fiesta and Escort ranges to keep them on the pace with the ever-growing number of new rivals that were threatening to decimate Ford's market share. Another new car launch that year was the Galaxy multi-purpose vehicle that was based upon the VW Sharan which quickly went straight to the top of the people carrier sales charts, remaining in production until the launch of an all-new replacement in 2006. Ford entered the city car market in September 1996 with its oddly-named and oddly-styled Ka, and was beaten into second place in the 1997 European Car of the Year award by the Renault Scenic. It made use of the Fiesta's chassis and 1300 cc petrol engine, which gave it strong handling for such a small car. Going against the appeal were its cramped rear seats and tiny boot, but it managed to sell well for most of its 12-year production run. Around the same time, the Mondeo gained a facelift which saw the exterior styling brought up to date and the seating redesigned to improve space for rear seat passengers. The Fiesta chassis also spawned the stylish Puma coup\u00e9 in 1997, which included the Fiesta's floorpan and 1. 4 engine as well as its own 1. 7 unit. The Puma won plaudits for its styling, handling and performance. Despite its popularity, there was no direct successor when production finished in 2002. Ford pulled out of the executive car market in 1998 upon the demise of its Scorpio, which had replaced the Granada four years earlier. As well as a Europe-wide transition from mainstream brands to prestige brands during the 1990s, the Scorpio's sales potential was held back by its controversial styling. In the late 1990s, Ford adopted a distinctive \"New Edge\" design on its model range. Some of the cars adopting this eye-catching new look were entirely new, while others were facelifted versions of earlier and more conservative designs. The end was in sight for the Escort in October 1998 when its distinctively-styled successor, the Focus, went on sale. Its radical design meant that Ford kept the Escort on sale alongside it for two years, the van until 2002, giving buyers a more conventionally-styled alternative, perhaps in fear of a repeat of the controversy it had faced some 15 years earlier when the Sierra was first on sale. But Ford need not have worried about the public's reaction to the new Focus, which was European Car of the Year for 1999 and one of the best-selling cars in the continent. At the height of its production, there was a new Ford Focus coming off a production line at an average of one every 12 seconds (Saarlouis, Germany; Valencia, Spain; Wayne, Michigan USA; Hermosillo, Mexico). However, the Focus was never built in Britain. 1998 also saw the launch of the Probe's replacement: the Cougar. Like its predecessor, the Cougar was built in America and used 2. 0 and 2. 5 petrol engines. Unlike its predecessor, it was based on the front-wheel-drive chassis of the Mondeo. It was very spacious for a coup\u00e9 and offered superb road-holding and cruising ability. Sales were relatively low in Europe and it was dropped in Europe after 2000, with sales limited to its home market. In 1999 Ford's European headquarters relocated from Brentwood in England to its current (2019) location in Cologne, Germany. It was from the adjacent Cologne factory that the 30 millionth Ford, a Fiesta, emerged from the production line on 19 November 1999. The aging Fiesta received its second facelift in the autumn of 1999 and continued to attract huge sales thanks to its excellent ride and handling that disguised its age well. The interior was, by now, one of the smartest in the supermini sector, though interior space \u2013 particularly in the back \u2013 was far from the best. This shortcoming was solved in Spring 2002 when the all-new Fiesta went on sale. This new Fiesta was to be built at Ford Cologne and Ford Valencia, each plant producing one Fiesta every 27 seconds. This also marked the end of Ford passenger car production in the UK after some 90 years, though commercial vehicles continued to be produced at Dagenham alongside the engine assembly for the passenger vehicles. In addition, Ford's Halewood plant was converted for Jaguar X-Type assembly in 2001. Ford also continued to build vans at its Southampton plant until relocating production to Turkey in 2013. The Ford Mondeo was relaunched in an all-new version in late 2000 and was pipped for the European Car of the Year award by the Alfa Romeo 147. The new Mondeo was more competitively priced than its predecessor, but its real strengths were its excellent accommodation and driving experience which put it back on top of the large family car sector. Although demand for cars of this size dipped slightly across Europe during the 2000s (decade), the Mondeo remained Britain's most popular large family car until 2007, when it was outsold by the facelifted Vauxhall Vectra. The Maverick returned in late 2000, this time being a rebadged US-market Escape which launched in the same year, but sales were slow and was axed after 4 years. The demise of the Puma in 2002 left Ford without a competitor in the coup\u00e9 sector once more while the Focus ST170 which launched at that time could been seen as an indirect successor. Ford entered the expanding compact MPV market in late 2003 with the Ford Focus C-Max, which was \u2013 unusually \u2013 the first car on the platform that would spawn the next generation Focus hatchback a year later. 2003 also saw a convertible version of the Ka launched as the StreetKa alongside a facelifted Mondeo. The second generation Focus hatchback, saloon and estate ranges went on sale in late 2004, picking up where the old model left off. Excellent ride and handling, good equipment levels, solid build quality and a comfortable interior all won praise for those who experienced the new car. The only major criticism of the Focus was its unoriginal style which differed little from that of its predecessor. It remained one of the most popular cars in Europe during a production life which lasted more than six years. 2006 saw Ford launch two new people carriers \u2013 the S-MAX and the Ford Galaxy MK2. Both cars used the same underpinnings, but the S-MAX was a cheaper and sportier alternative to the more upmarket and practical Galaxy. The S-MAX then became the first full-size people carrier to be voted European Car of the Year. Ford launched the third generation Mondeo in May 2007 and new versions of the Fiesta and Ka in late 2008. 4 years after the Maverick was axed, Ford returned to the 4x4 market in early 2008 with the Focus-based Kuga. In 2005, Ford celebrated its 30th anniversary as Britain's most popular car brand. The Focus was the country's top-selling car, while the Fiesta occupied fifth place and the Mondeo ninth. In spite of this, the gap between Ford and its competitors was about as narrow as it had ever been, with Vauxhall and Renault just a short margin behind Ford in sales figures. In 2008, Ford acquired a majority stake in Automobile Craiova, Romania. The Ford Transit Connect was Ford's first model produced in Craiova, followed in 2012 by the new Fiesta-based MPV B-Max and the small displacement engine 1. 0-litre EcoBoost. The first major car launch by Ford under the new \"One Ford\" policy for the 2010s was the third generation Focus in the spring of 2011. For Europe, the Focus featured a lesser model range than its predecessors, with only a five-door hatchback and five-door estate being sold there were no saloon or three-door hatchback versions although the former bodystyle was sold in some European nations. The larger Mondeo had been facelifted the previous autumn but this did little to halt dwindling sales over the next three years. Early 2013 saw the launch of a new-generation Kuga. In 2013, Ford announced that it would close three of its factories in Europe: two of them in the UK, the Southampton facility (manufacturing the Ford Transit van) and the associated stamping facility in Dagenham in mid-2013; and the Genk, Belgium major car plant (producing the Mondeo and the Galaxy and S-Max MPV's) by the end of 2014. This amounted for 1,400 and 4,300 job cuts respectively, in an attempt by the company to stem losses in Europe on the background of a declining market. After several delays and moving production to Valencia, Ford eventually launched a new-generation Mondeo in late 2014 which was based upon the US-market Fusion, but unlike its predecessors it isn't as good to drive and its popularity falling even further, around the same time, a facelifted Focus went on sale, as did a new small SUV, the EcoSport. 2015 saw new versions of the S-Max & Galaxy MPV's launch which are again based on the Mondeo while the facelifted C-Max also launched. In 2016, Ford once again returned to the coupe market with the US-sourced Mustang which would also be sold in RHD in the UK for the first time while the Edge crossover also joined the European line-up. In late 2016, 20 years after the original launched, Ford relaunched the Ka as the Ka+ which would now be a five-door hatchback made in India but hasn't enjoyed the popularity of the original car. Around the same time, a facelifted Kuga launched. 2017 saw the big-selling Fiesta enter its seventh-generation. It retained the dimensions of its predecessor but with new styling and more new features than ever before while new additions to the range includes an upmarket Vignale version as well as an SUV-inspired version called the Active. 20 years after the original model launched, Ford's big-selling Focus entered its fourth-generation with all-new styling and being better to drive than its predecessor and like the smaller Fiesta also saw Vignale & Active models join the line-up. The Commercial vehicles arm of Ford of Britain, was part of the operation until it was sold to Fiat's Iveco division in 1986. Its last significant models under Ford ownership were the Transcontinental and the Cargo. Ford has planned to build the European version F-Series pick-up trucks in Germany for the European market. The Production of tractors in Europe by Ford has ceased following the sale of the division to Fiat in 1993 and the name changed from Ford New Holland to New Holland. New Holland Ag is now part of CNH Global. Tractor production had been based at the Antwerp, Basildon and Cork factories. Ford produce high-performance derivatives of their cars developed by their Ford Team RS division.\n",

The target was Welsh League 2000, a 5-year plan. 1998\u201399 \u2013 Runners up in the Senior League once again. 1999\u20132000 \u2013 Senior League winners, South Wales Intermediate Cup winners but lost the play off for a place in the Welsh League to Dinas Powys. 2000\u201301 \u2013 After a successful appeal, Bettws won the 3rd Division title at the first attempt. 2001\u201302 \u2013 Followed on with a 2nd place promotion from Division 2, behind Garden Village. 2002\u201303 \u2013 Bettws went into the 1st Division hoping to consolidate at mid table but achieved much more. Runners up to Neath in the League Cup. Welsh League winners. However, this magnificent achievement came too early for Bettws to progress into the FAW Premier League due to inadequate facilities. 2005\u201306 \u2013 Unfortunately relegation became a reality on the final day of the season. 2007\u201308 \u2013 Greater success followed with promotion back to the first division \u2013 by six clear points before relegation loomed again in the 2009\u201310 season. 2010\u201311 \u2013 Once again personnel changes bring some instability to the club but a mid-table finish in division 2 was achieved. 2011\u201312 \u2013 A poor season by Bettws standards, resulting in relegation to Division 3 for the first team. The reserve team, however, were runners up in the cup. 2012\u201313 \u2013 A young team remained in the Welsh League, only due to a late restructure of the 3rd division to include 19 (rather than the usual 16) teams. 2013\u201314 \u2013 A mid table finish ensured the team would play Welsh League football again next season.\n",

        "reference": " project was announced in March 2005, to capitalize on a condominium boom occurring in Las Vegas at the time. Groundbreaking took place in May 2006, and the tower was topped off in August 2007. Palms Place opened in 2008, during the Great Recession, and some buyers had difficulty completing their unit purchases because of poor economic conditions. Palms Place was announced by George Maloof on March 2, 2005, as part of a $600 million expansion of the Palms resort, which was opened by the Maloof family in 2001. The Palms Place tower would include 599 condo hotel units. The project was meant to capitalize on a condominium boom occurring in Las Vegas at the time. Construction of the tower was scheduled to begin in 2006. Additional hotel rooms were originally planned for the property until 2004, when condo-hotel units were chosen instead because of the demand for residential units. The Los Angeles-based Jerde Partnership was the designer for Palms Place. Units in the tower had already generated buyer interest prior to the project's official announcement, at which point more than 50 percent of the units had been reserved. The Palms' existing customer base included actors, musicians, and sports figures who were interested in purchasing units in the tower. Most of the remaining units were sold within a couple months. The project was initially expected to cost $300 million, although rising construction costs brought the budget to $350 million. Sales prices were increased six times over the next year to keep up with the rising construction costs. The project was financed by Wells Fargo, and M.J. Dean was the general contractor. A groundbreaking ceremony took place on May 5, 2006, and the tower was topped off on August 10, 2007. A certificate of occupancy was issued in February 2008, and the first residents were expected to begin moving in at the end of the month. The tower's penthouses were still under construction and were expected to be finished by May 2008. Individual owners had the option of renting out their units as hotel rooms, for a 50 percent profit. A grand opening event was held on May 31, 2008, and was attended by various celebrities, as well as George Maloof. The property opened during the Great Recession. Maloof said, \"Sometimes you can't help when you open. You just have to work hard and live through it\". As of October 2008, sales had only been finalized for 342 units, or 57 percent of the 599 units. Because of poor economic conditions, buyers had difficulty obtaining the necessary credit to finalize their purchases. In May 2009, the Palms began offering financial assistance to approximately 150 buyers who had already made down payments but were unable to get full financing to close on their purchases. At the time, 370 unit sales had been finalized. Notable residents have included Jessica Simpson, Eminem, Paul Stanley, Hulk Hogan, and Floyd Mayweather Jr. Phil Maloof owned a Palms Place penthouse, which he put up for sale in 2014, at a cost of $38 million. The purchase would include artwork by Pablo Picasso and Salvador Dal\u00ed. After months without a buyer, Maloof decided to include a Lamborghini Hurac\u00e1n as part of the purchase. The Muleseum, a  suite dedicated to the Moscow mule cocktail, was debuted in March 2018. The suite included a bar with several variations of the drink available. Maloof put his penthouse on the market again in 2019, with a $15 million listing price. Turnkey Pads, a vacation property company, purchased the penthouse later that year for $12. 5 million, making it the most expensive high-rise condo sale in Las Vegas history. Turnkey spent $1 million to renovate the penthouse and add a helipad. The company began renting the penthouse out in December 2019, with prices ranging from $5,000 to $25,000 a night. Turnkey also owned and managed approximately 100 other units at Palms Place. Palms Place consists of a 47-story condo hotel tower, located on the western end of the Palms resort property. Palms Place is connected to the main Palms resort through a moving walkway known as the SkyTube. Residential units include  studios,  suites with one bedroom, and penthouses ranging  to. The tower contains 21 penthouses, occupying the top four floors. Amenities include concierge service, 24-hour room service, and a business center. The property also features a  pool and spa, known as Drift Spa. The spa spans two floors and includes a fitness center, the first Turkish bath in Las Vegas, the Palms Place Salon, and a tanning salon named Sunset Tan. A bar, Rojo Lounge, operates in the lobby. A restaurant, Simon Restaurant and Lounge, opened in May 2008. It was operated by chef Kerry Simon. The restaurant was located in a  space on the sixth floor, next to the pool area, offering a view of it via floor-to-ceiling windows. The restaurant's design consisted of Earth elements such as fire, stone, water and wood, as well as an herb wall of living plants. The eatery's target clientele was young and hip people. The restaurant included a sushi bar, and eventually became popular for its Sunday brunch. Servers would wear pajamas during brunch, and customers had the option to do so as well. The restaurant became a popular dining spot for celebrities. Scenes would later be shot at the restaurant for The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills and La La's Full Court Life. In July 2008, Palms Place introduced a weekly, evening pool party event that would start off with cocktails in the Simon restaurant before moving to the pool deck for DJ music and swimming. During the first month, the pool parties featured $7,000 worth of rubber ducks. The 25,000 ducks came in a variety of colors and designs. The Duck Party returned in 2012, with more than 25,000 rubber ducks. In February 2015, it was announced that Simon would close in three months when its lease was scheduled to expire. At the time, chef Simon was battling multiple system atrophy, and he celebrated his birthday at the restaurant shortly before its closure. The Simon restaurant was replaced by Cafe 6, which opened in May 2015. Caf\u00e9 6, named after its location on the sixth floor, featured a new menu focused on burgers. In 2018, Cafe 6 was replaced by Laguna Pool House & Kitchen.\n",

        "prefix": "Vladimir G. Dubrovskii  (; born in 1965) is the head of Laboratory of physics of nanostructures at St.",
        "reference": " Petersburg Academic University, a leading research scientist at Ioffe Institute, and a professor at St. Petersburg State University and ITMO University. Dubrovskii graduated from St. Petersburg State University, Department of Statistical Physics, in 1988, with a diploma in theoretical physics. In 1991, he was a post-doc research fellow in Oxford University. He obtained his PhD in 1990 and a doctor of sciences degree in 2002, in condensed matter physics. Dubrovskii has made contributions to several fields of physics. He is best known for growth modeling of semiconductor nanostructures, particularly III-V nanowires. Starting from 2003, he has been at the forefront of research in this field, collaborating with more than 40 groups in 18 countries (with joint publications). His main area is in kinetically controlled engineering of nanostructures, including morphology, crustal phase, and size distributions. In 2005, he and coauthors proved a diffusion-induced character of gold-assisted vapor-liquid-solid (VLS) growth of GaAs nanowires by molecular beam epitaxy [1]. In 2008-2014, following Frank Glas [2], he developed theoretical approaches for understanding and controlling polytypism of III-V nanowires by the growth parameter tuning [3] and catalyst material [4]. This allowed achieving record small GaAs nanowires (down to 5\u00a0nm in radius) with pure zincblende structure [5]. Independently of Jerry Tersoff [6], in 2013-2015 he predicted a non-linear focusing effect [7,8] that enabled self-organized ensembles of GaAs nanowires with uniform radii [8]. The works of 2016 brought up the new size distributions describing length statistics in nanowire ensembles [9,10]. In 2015-2016, he developed the first theory for the compositional control of ternary III-V nanowires [11], sharpening their axial heterointerfaces [12] and, more generally, nucleation theory of ternary solids from ternary and quaternary liquid alloys. He contributed into understanding the VLS versus selective area growth of nanowires [13] and self-induced nucleation of GaN nanowires on silicon substrates [14]. In 2009, Dubrovskii discovered fluctuation-induced broadening (the Dubrovskii broadening) of the size distributions described by a Fokker-Planck type kinetic equation in terms of the Kuni invariant variables [15], and presented a map of the power exponents for the spectrum spreading in 2D and 3D systems. Further studies revealed the influence of kinetic fluctuations on the size distributions of islands and droplets in the stages of their nucleation, growth, and Ostwald ripening [16,17]. He also contributed into binary nucleation theory with a saddle point of the formation energy, with applications in growth theory of strain-induced islands [18] and ternary VLS nanowires. In 1996, he published exact solution for the infinite set of rate equations for heterogeneous growth with size-linear rate constants [19], reduced to one-parametric Polya distribution. Further investigation of the growth systems with size-linear capture rates led to a two-parametric modified beta-distribution (2015) [20] which acquires the Vicsek-Family scaling form [21] in the continuum limit. Distributions of this type are now widely used for modeling the growth kinetics of semiconductor nanostructures, surface islands and biological objects. Since 2004, Dubrovskii pursued growth theories in confined systems with a limited amount of growth species in the mother phase. He developed concepts of \u201cmononuclear\u201d growth [22,23] whereby individual nucleation events predetermine physical properties of emerging nanomaterials. He developed methods of using different size-dependent effects for narrowing size distributions [8,24-26]. Together with Frank Glas, he predicted narrow sub-Poissonian size distributions [27] in systems with nucleation antibunching [28], and derived analytical asymptotes for their time-independent shapes. He and coauthors developed semi-analytical models for elastic relaxation and misfit dislocations in nanostructures grown on lattice-mismatched substrates [29] and contributed into development of epitaxial techniques for monolithic integration of high quality optical III-V nanostructures with silicon electronic platform [8,18,30]. Dubrovskii prefers analytical calculations to computers and tries to present theoretical models for complex growth behavior in a simple analytic form with a minimum number of physically transparent parameters. Dubrovskii main areas are currently in modeling and shaping of sophisticated nanowire nanoheterostructures, nucleation theory in the nanoscale, physical chemistry of alloys and compounds, and analytic size distributions. He is working with experimentalists on design and functionalization of optoelectronic nanoheterostructures. Dubrovskii is lecturing in nucleation theory, epitaxy of nanostructures and growth modeling of nanowires. He has supervised 10 PhD students, 2 of them under European Marie Curie Initial Training Networks. V. G.

The Admiralty Underwater Weapons Establishment, built as a Gunnery Establishment at the beginning of the Cold War, was closed in 1995 alongside Portland's naval base. The establishment buildings remained empty for two years, until Roy Haywood and Ray Bulpit, whose business was the acquisition and development of former military sites, purchased the site in 1997. The first tenants of Southwell Business Park arrived that year, and the park continued to expand its range of business tenants. In the 2000s, the site was recorded as employing almost 500 people and being home to over 100 businesses. It was estimated that the total turnover generated at the park from 1997 to 2008 reached over \u00a3200 million. In 2006, work commenced on developing unused parts of the park, including an unused 1970s-built wing, into the Portland Spa and an 80-bedroom hotel, known as the Venue Hotel. Completed in 2007, the spa included a gym, a fitness studio and an indoor swimming pool. The Orchid Restaurant was also converted from the former AUWE canteen. It was later renamed to the Cliff Panoramic Restaurant and Bar. In 2010, the park went into administration after the UK recession made it difficult to repay borrowed money used to create the spa and hotel. The site was sold to Compass Point Estates. After a succession of ownership changes and names, the tenants of the Ocean Spa took over the hotel and restaurant in 2013. In 2016, the Isle of Portland Aldridge Community Academy's new \u00a314 million campus was opened within the park. The Ocean Spa and Hotel had closed in 2014 due to the new school premises, however by 2015 the hotel had reopened with new management, and was named Ocean Hotel and Bar. The hotel is currently known as the Maritime Hotel. In 2017, business and enterprise director Calvin Samways acquired a stretch of real estate at Southwell Business Park from the Compass Point Estates for a six figure sum. The unused site was then redeveloped into seven industrial units, named the Network Enterprise Complex (NEC).

        "reference": ", Germany. The 10-day event interchanges with a 4 day intermezzo in years with an odd number. Apart from musical performances of traditional and contemporary music from the wider Middle Eastern region, other art genres, such as the visual arts, dance and theatre or interdisciplinary projects, have also been part of the festival programme. The festival first took place in 2005. Michael Dreyer, initiator and founder of the festival, is still its Artistic Director. It is committed to challenging traditional perceptions of the \u201cOrient\u201d. For this, it offers the participating artists time and space, in which they can realize their projects. The musical programme is therefore not imported as a finished product, but is mostly developed on site. Apart from renowned artists such as Alim Qasimov (Azerbaijan), Kayhan Kalhor (Iran), Jivan Gasparyan (Armenia), the NDR Bigband or Salman Gambarov (Azerbaijan), many artists who were hitherto unknown in the West from countries such as Iran, Iraq, Syria, Pakistan, Lebanon, Israel, Egypt, Azerbaijan, Xinjiang or Turkey have performed at the festival. Highlights of the festival have included guest performances by the Tehran Symphony Orchestra - with works by Persian composers, but also by Beethoven, Tchaikovsky and Frank Zappa \u2013 and by the Osnabr\u00fcck Symphony Orchestra in Tehran, as well as a performance of Bach's St John Passion in Tehran by the Osnabr\u00fcck Youth Choir. The \u201cMorgenland Chamber Orchestra\u201d has been an integral part of the Festival since 2009: German musicians, together with musicians from the guest countries and diverse soloists, rehearse works which are then performed at the opening of the festival. Past conductors of the orchestra were Nader Mashayekhi (Iran) and Kinan Azmeh (Syria). A further integral part of the festival is the annual exchange of students from the Music and Art School in Osnabr\u00fcck and the Barenboim-Said Conservatory in Nazareth. The participating students each spend a week in the host country and rehearse a programme, which is then performed at the end of the festival. The Morgenland Festival Osnabr\u00fcck is a cooperation between the City of Osnabr\u00fcck and the Culture Centre Lagerhalle Osnabr\u00fcck. Various institutions and companies support the Morgenland Festival Osnabr\u00fcck financially. Long-term patrons of the event are the Stiftung Niedersachsen (Lower Saxony Foundation), the Nieders\u00e4chsische Sparkassenstiftung (Foundation of the Lower Saxony Savings Banks), the Sparkasse Osnabr\u00fcck, Musikland Niedersachsen, the Lower Saxony Ministry of Science and Culture, NDR Musikf\u00f6rderung (NDR Music Patronage), the Landschaftsverband Osnabr\u00fccker Land (Regional Authority for the Rural District of Osnabr\u00fcck), Sievert AG and Hinrichs Licht und Druck. In 2009 Michael Dreyer received the Lower Saxony Praetorius Music Award in the category \u201cInternational Award for Music for Peace\u201d. Since 2009, the charitable organisation Society of Friends of the Morgenland Festival has focused its activities towards collecting funds to finance projects relating to the Festival. They have so far produced a documentary book of photographs (2005\u20132009) as well as a documentary film, \u201cEastern Voices\u201d, which is available as Blu-ray and DVD from EuroArts.

        "prefix": "Silchester is a village and civil parish about  north of Basingstoke in Hampshire. It is adjacent to the county boundary with Berkshire and about  south",
        "reference": "-west of Reading. Silchester is most notable for the archaeological site and Roman town of Calleva Atrebatum, an Iron Age and later Atrebates Celtic settlement first occupied by the Romans in about AD 45 and includes what is considered the best-preserved Roman wall in Great Britain and the remains of what might be one of the oldest Christian churches. The present village is centred on Silchester Common. It is about  west of the Church of England parish church and former manor house (now Manor Farm), which are in the eastern part of the former Roman town. Silchester is a civil parish with an elected parish council. Silchester parish is in the ward of Pamber and Silchester, part of Basingstoke and Deane District Council and of Hampshire County Council and all three councils are responsible for different aspects of local government. The ward returns two councillors to the borough council. The 2011 census recorded a parish population of 921. Silchester Common is served (as of October 2017) by bus route 14 between Basingstoke, Chineham Shopping Centre, Bramley, Little London, Silchester Common and Tadley, operated by Stagecoach on Monday to Saturday. Silcester was recorded in the 11th century, when one Alestan held a manor here with King Edward the Confessor as his overlord and one Cheping held another manor with Earl Harold Godwinson as his overlord. The Domesday Book of 1086 recorded that the Normans William De Ow and Ralph de Mortimer possessed Alestan's and Cheping's manors respectively. The book assessed Alestan's manor at five hides and Mortimer's at three hides. De Mortimer's tenant was another Norman, Ralph Bluet. In 1204 he or a later Ralph Bluet gave a palfrey horse in exchange for a licence to enclose an area of land south-east of the former Roman town as a deer park. Today parts of the earthwork park pale survive and parts of the former park remain wooded. Forms of the toponym included Ciltestere and Cilcestre in the 13th century, Scilchestre in the 14th century and Sylkchester in the 18th century before it reached its current spelling. The Irish peer Murrough Boyle, 1st Viscount Blesington (1685\u20131718) bought the manor in 1704 and it remained with his hereditary heirs until the death of William Stewart, 1st Earl of Blessington in 1769. In 1778 it was inherited jointly by Thomas Vesey, 1st Viscount de Vesci and Edward Pakenham, 2nd Baron Longford. In 1806 Baron Longford's daughter The Hon. Catherine Pakenham married Arthur Wellesley, who in 1814 was created Duke of Wellington. In 1821 Catherine's brother Thomas Pakenham, 2nd Earl of Longford was created Baron Silchester, but in 1828 he and John, 2nd Viscount de Vesci sold the manor of Silchester to the Duke. In the first decade of the 20th century Arthur Wellesley, 4th Duke of Wellington still owned the manor of Silchester. The Church of England parish church of St Mary the Virgin is just within the walls of the former Roman town, possibly on the site of a Roman temple. The building may contain some re-used Roman materials. The building dates from the late 12th or early 13th century. It has a north and south aisle, each of two bays. There is no chancel arch, and the chancel is longer than the nave. The wall of the south aisle was rebuilt in about 1325\u201350, incorporating an ogee-arched tomb recess containing the effigy of a lady wearing a wimple. Two new windows were added to the church the 14th century and two more including the Perpendicular Gothic east window of the chancel in the 15th century. The church has a Perpendicular Gothic rood screen. The pulpit was made early in the 18th century but its tester is dated 1639. There is also a carved memorial cartouche to the Irish peer Viscount Ikerrin (died 1712). The bell-turret has a ring of five bells. Four were cast by John Stares of Aldbourne, Wiltshire in 1744. The other was cast by William Taylor of Oxford in 1848. There is a Primitive Methodist chapel on Silchester Common. Calleva Atrebatum on the Fosse Way was an Iron Age oppidum and subsequently a town in the Roman province of Britannia and the civitas capital of the Atrebates tribe. Its ruins are beneath and to the west of the parish church, which is itself just within the town wall and about  to the east of the modern village. The site covers an area of over  within a polygonal earthwork. The earthworks and extensive ruined walls are still visible. The remains of the amphitheatre, added about AD 70\u201380 and situated outside the city walls, can also be clearly seen. The area inside the walls is now largely farmland with no visible distinguishing features, other than the enclosing earthworks and walls, with the church and old manor house in one corner. The bronze Silchester eagle was discovered in the Basilica at Calleva in 1866. It can now be seen in Reading Museum. During excavations carried out in 1893, the Silchester Ogham stone was located. Dated c. 500 AD, it is one of very few found in England. It is now held in storage at Reading Museum. Calleva was finally abandoned in the 7th century, which is unusually late compared to other deserted Roman settlement. Silchester's sole public house is the Calleva Arms, named after the former Roman town of Calleva Atrebatum that lies within the village boundary. It was known as The Crown prior to being renamed. The parish has regular events and village activities through the year including a beer festival, fun run, church fete, and music festival. The village has an amateur dramatic society and a village association. Silchester Cricket Club compete in Regional Division Three North East in the Hampshire Cricket League. Silchester has a Church of England aided primary school. Most Silchester children of secondary school age attend The Hurst Community College in Baughurst. Silchester was voted \"Hampshire Village of the Year\" (2008) and \"South England Village of the Year\" (2009) in the Calor Village of the Year competition.\n",
